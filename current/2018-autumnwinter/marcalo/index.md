#### In Brief      
A perambulating, itinerant dance work stops off in Salford on its way from Guildford (the place Rita lived in when she arrived in the UK as an Erasmus student in 1994) to Cloughjordan (the rural Irish village that she is moving to post-Brexit).

#### More         
>"As I dance my way through the UK I will meet and stay with other EU citizens, who will walk/dance part of the way with me. Each EU citizen will choreograph a section of One Last Dance, and choreographic sections will then be linked to one another via linear accumulation. I will encounter dance/arts organisations, festivals and venues which have been part of my work in the UK over the past 24 years. At each of these encounters I will perform One Last Dance to the accumulative stage that it will be at. As I enter the island of Ireland, the work shifts into its next stage: An Chéad Damhsa, which in English means My First Dance. Eventually I will reach my final destination (Cloughjordan), where I will finally perform the entire accumulated choreography and audio testimonies.
>*I expect…*<br>That the walk will be physically exhausting.<br>That engaging with the testimony and fears of those EU citizens who, by choice or need, are staying in the UK will be emotionally exhausting.<br>That saying goodbye to the country which was my home for so many years will be an emotional journey.
>*I fear…*<br>That I might encounter some antagonism towards me throughout the walk.<br>That I won’t physically be able to do it.
>*I doubt…*<br>That I won’t physically be able to do it.
>*I wish…*<br>That the work will have contributed to an increased awareness around the Home Office’s hostile environment policy towards immigration in general, and more specifically to those EU citizens who will acquire settled status in the UK.<br>That my sadness around Brexit will have transformed into gratitude for the many beautiful years I have had in the country.<br>That by the end, the work will feel like my final love letter to the UK."

#### Who are they        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject and medium. Alongside lifting the veil on the Secret State in their first theatrical examination of contemporary politics (*A Machine they're Secretly Building* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2017](/archive/2017-spring/proto-type)), this has included a two-week long theatrical experience using pervasive technologies (*Fortnight*), a multimedia concert-performance featuring animation and live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2014](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)), and a radio drama with the BBC.        
        
Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US + Zimbabwe: founded in New York City by Peter S. Petralia (1997-2006), relocating to Lancaster's Storey Institute (2006-10), then Manchester's Northern Quarter (2010-14), and now Lincoln's Cathedral Quarter, they make and support work across the region.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
