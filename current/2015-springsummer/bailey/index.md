*Presented by* Contact + Word of Warning *during* Flying Solo Festival 2015         
       
####In Brief      
Tales of paranoia, young love and ultra-violence in a spiralling odyssey of pitch-black humour and nightmarish prose. A prime slice of surrealist trash, an Americana death trip and a dizzying exorcism for a world convinced it is dying.
