####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Maelstrom Theatre | *Oversight***        
*Oversight* is the 'what if ?' situation. What if you didn't press enter but you pressed delete? What if you went for a fag break 5 minutes before the fire alarm? What if you missed Armageddon warnings? Maelstrom creates a DEFCON 1 situation for just your average office worker; using physical and dance theatre to create their trademark dark and surreal world, they invite you to the worst job appraisal ever…        
        
Maelstrom Theatre is founder Lindsey Brocklebank and co-creators/performers Paul Doyle, Anthony Briggs + Sarah Lockwood; Lighting Designer Murray Smoker has been the company's technical designer for 5 years.

**Lo-Giudice Dance | *The Teeth Behind The Kisses***        
Inspired by time spent with artist Hector De Gregorio and his study on the theme of 'Ecstasy', two performers take to the stage to capture themes of the Divine and terrestrial, quiet and rapturous, extreme love and extreme pain. The work combines modern art and classical design to reveal religious overtones and eroticism.

**Rachel Sweeney | *Tradewinds/Taste of China***        
This solo is informed by the composite metamorphosis from rock to liquid mass, and employs a minimalist Butoh movement aesthetic. The title reflects the spatial arrangement for this work and is based upon the old mining process of changing composite granite into china clay.

**Ebony-Rose + Lorienne Aimée | *More than high heels and lipstick***        
A performance based on the concept of how women are viewed in society; devised using autobiographical elements and dance.        
            
Created + performed by: Ebony-Rose Kirk + Lorienne Aimée Simpson          
           
**Peter Grist + Company | *M.E.N.***        
Drawing upon an idea contained within the Greek myth *Pygmalion* — a tale about a sculptor who falls in love with a female statue of his own creation, an exploration of narcissism in relationships. The work revolves around a male duet performed in a marked-out space. So what are we to do? How do we protect ourselves from narcissists if they're so adept at slipping into our lives unnoticed?

**Joshua Hubbard | *Monochrome to colour***           
This solo is two ideas merged together, focusing on the idea of transformation through visually striking imagery and highly physical movement.

**Sophie Unwin | *The Chronicles Of Joy***         
*The Chronicles Of Joy* takes all the manuals, mantras and You Tube tutorials about happiness and throws them out of the
window. Because you are not alone, she is not happier than you are and you were better off without him anyway. Rule number 1, say yes.         
         
Music: *Gus on the bus* by The Travelling Salesman, *My Way* by Twinkle Twinkle Little Rockstar | Thanks: Yorkshire Dance, Peggy Olislaegers, Beth Cassani, Hollie Harkness-Gowers + Emanuele Pecorari
