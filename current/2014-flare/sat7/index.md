####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Hannah Sullivan (UK) | *Echo Beach***              
Hannah has a dance collection, it is a collection she has been gathering for a while, since 1999 in fact. It's in the details, that's what makes your dance so specific, whether you dance with your hips or your elbows, whether your eyes are open or closed.         
                        
>*Touching and poignant, funny and nostalgic… It was a beautiful balance of fragments and narrative, humour and depth, an openness cultivated with the audience.*<br> Laura Burns, Mayfest Diary 2013                 
                     
Hannah makes playful and emotive solo work for studio and site. A BA graduate of Dartington College of Arts in Theatre and a MA graduate of the University of Bristol in Performance Research, Hannah has been based in Bristol making and producing theatre in many forms since 2009, and is supported by artist-led support network, Interval.

**Marius Mensink (The Netherlands) | *Mick Jagger is my nightmare***                 
The moves of Jagger are remarkable to say the least. With wide-spread arms, tense fingers, loose hips, kicking feet and rubber lips he undoubtedly possesses an iconic dancing style. In *Mick Jagger is my nightmare* we see how the legendary rock musician and front-man of the Rolling Stones tries to take possession of the body of the almost half a century younger, theatrical performer, Marius Mensink. In an exhausting struggle they fight for existence, the crowd and the stage — an exorcistic battle between body and mind.                   
                 
Marius Mensink (age 26) graduated in 2013 as a theatrical performer from the Theatre Academy in Maastricht, The Netherlands. With *Mick Jagger is my nightmare*, his graduation solo, he won the Silver award at the Amsterdam Fringe Festival. As a multidisciplinary performer he now works with a variety of theatremakers throughout Europe whilst performing his own work worldwide.                 
                               
**Walk of Shame (Norway) | *I Saw the Sign (Oooo is enough enough)***              
Prepare yourself for a night in the woods, the last day on Earth, the last hour before closing time in a bar. Don’t be shy. IT'S A PARTY. Sometimes, the sounds you hear are not what they seem. The space around you is your personal space. Party snacks will be provided.                      
                  
WALK OF SHAME is a group of artists with a background in theatre studies at the University of Bergen, Norway, the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki, the Art School in Bergen and the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies in Giessen, Germany; works include *Aint nobody home over there*, *Last Christmas*, *Waiting for Magic*, *Back to Basics vs. 1* and *Back to Basics vs. 2*. The group works at the interface between Apollonian and Dionysian energies and the dichotomy of nature/culture. *I Saw the Sign (Oooo is enough enough)* is the group’s sixth project, and operates in a landscape of comfortable interactivity, equality of means and the dramaturgy of the space.                
                  
**Almost Human (The Netherlands/UK) | *A Grindhouse Dante***                     
A 'live film' of Dante Alighieri's *Inferno*; using DIY film-making machines, naked Barbie dolls and Action Men, botched special effects, and overweight performers in green morph suits, *A Grindhouse Dante* takes you on a cinematic rollercoaster — culminating in a bizarre and frantic choreography of shambolic puppetry. Featuring a performer-powered pedestal which rotates the camera, green screen and 360° lighting, the film is created through the manipulation of objects in front of the camera as it turns. Join them on a journey seen through Dante’s eyes, as we travel through hell’s unsettling and strangely beautiful bleak landscape.                   
                       
Almost Human is an international performance/experimental theatre group whose members are interested in making inventive and stimulating work through the use of technology and challenging scenographic practices. Their work intertwines the technical with the living, moving between digital and live space in real time to create performance that exists somewhere in between film, theatre and installation.

**Moeremans&Sons (The Netherlands) | *My Own Private Disaster***              
Whoever witnesses a disastrous event and is able to survive, will find themselves as the centre of every party. In a world obsessed by fortune, in which we keep getting better at protecting ourselves against various discomforts, there is *My Own Private Disaster*. You will be the proud owner of a sensational story, witness of a catastrophic happening, without a grain of pain, but guaranteed success among your friends. Put your thirst for sensation aside and enjoy misfortune for once. After all, misfortune is part of the game…            
                     
A short performance based on Orson Wells's radio play *War Of The Worlds* (1938); in 20 minutes, Moeremans&Sons build a catastrophic disaster — complete with victims, heroic firefighters, a sensationalist-reporter to guide the witnessing audience through the chaos, and the narrow escape of fatal consequences at the end.        
                   
*Admit it, if you had the chance to face Death with the certainty not to be forced to shake his hand, wouldn’t you take it?*
