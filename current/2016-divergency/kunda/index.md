#### In Brief                           
What are the real laws of attraction?    
Unlikely bed-fellows quantum mechanics, existentialism and erotic dance combine in this celebration of female sensuality from a feminist perspective.

#### More               
"People assume that people lap-dance just because they really need the money and have no other options, through circumstance or education. So, as quite a bookish, published poet, why on earth did I decide to do a lap-dancing course? The truth is I absolutely fell in love with it as a performance style and means of self-expression.  This led me to think about my body as a black woman and how I can find ways of exploring the ownership of it and I came up with the central question of how is a black woman’s sex like quantum mechanics and existentialism.  This is my attempt to answer it..."    
 
Developed with Director Benji Reid and Dramaturge Malika Booker.
