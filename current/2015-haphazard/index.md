*Presented by* Word of Warning + Z-arts          

###Saturday 28 February 2015, 12noon-4pm. Free             
Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic Z-arts' building… From quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or *save the bees!*)                           
                       
Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out! *Turn up at any time and come and go as you please.*
