####In Brief    
Jess is stuck. Her lifelong friend, Chris, can’t help. The others are out getting wasted. And the world is falling apart.    
Luckily Jess and Chris have a cooler full of beer, a goofy rapport, a series of dance moves - and a sincere desire to make you, the audience, happy.            
Or so they claim.    
They also claim that each other are liars. That they only met last year. And that they are eyewitnesses to the key world events of the last hundred years.                
A flat-out, unhinged and very normal performance about trying to connect: to the person next to you and to the unknown victim of a televised tragedy.            
*We Hope That You’re Happy (Why Would We Lie?)* is a hilarious and unsettling examination of what it means to be a tuned-in, delusional and unwitting consumer in a hyper-communicative world.

####More    
Formed in 2009 and already a National Theatre Studio affiliate company, Made In China debuted with *Stationary Excess*, performed on an exercise bike at Underbelly, Edinburgh 2010 before transferring to the Shunt Lounge.  Part of Forest Fringe’s Edinburgh 2011 programme, the two hander *We Hope That You’re Happy…* turned more heads with an unhinged, riotous mix of new writing and live art that informs the company’s unique style.

####Who are they    
Made In China is the collaborative work of Tim Cowbury and Jessica Latowicki. They make visceral shows at the juncture of playwriting and live art, for audiences who are fans of neither and both. So far, the shows have been physical, playful, excessive and destructive. Made In China are drawn to great stories but like to disrupt them with things like bad dancing, beer downing, interval training and downright lying. Each show makes its own rules. And each show aims to ask the audience difficult questions whilst giving them a really good time.            
Made in China formed in 2009. Their work has been seen across the UK and internationally at venues including: BAC, The ICA, Shunt Lounge, Riverside Studios, The Junction, Warwick Arts Centre, Hull Truck Theatre, Tobacco Factory Theatre, Arcola Theatre, La MaMa ETC (New York).
