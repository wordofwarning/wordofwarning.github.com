#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
Please note that as not everyone who reserves tickets uses them, to make sure we have a full house we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right, but unfortunately we occasionally have to disappoint people so please arrive early. However, where possible, if you do miss out we will try to get you in to another show at The Lowry that evening.
