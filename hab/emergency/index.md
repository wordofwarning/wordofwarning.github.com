Somewhat of an institution in these parts, **Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance featuring up to 40 short pieces of work in a single day, across a number of Manchester venues.     
     
To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2012 [programme](/archive/2012-emergency) and [gallery](/galleries/2012-emergency) from the 2012 event.    

In 2013 the fourteenth Emergency takes place on **Saturday 5 October**, at BLANKSPACE (12-4pm) and Z-arts (3-11pm) with the callout for proposals open from **Friday 12 July** to **Wednesday 14 August, 5pm** — details are posted [here](http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com).    

With a whole range of spaces to fill - and the journey between spaces to think about too - what we now need is a lots of great work! So...    

*Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works in progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event. Proposals are also encouraged for durational, one to one and limited capacity work and performance installation and works which inhabit the journey between the spaces.*    

Emergency is:    
>a free public micro-festival;   
>an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work;      
>a selection event for a number of small Works Ahead commissions to be developed & supported by hÅb;    
    
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be 20 minutes max in duration, low tech and suitable for quick turnarounds, self-supporting in terms of props/set/equipment and specialised technology.    

We also strongly encourage durational, one to one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces and on the journey from BLANKSPACE to Z-arts.    

*Emergency cannot pay fees or expenses (though we do feed you quite well!)*

**DEADLINE Wed 14 August 2013, 5pm.**   
 
**BLANKSPACE Upstairs Commission**  
In addition we are looking for **one durational piece**, working within specific criteria, to occupy the Main Exhibition Space, upstairs at BLANKSPACE. We realise that the criteria are specific and there is therefore a budget of £250 available for this work. This is a challenging space – as it is surrounded by alcoves, in which there will be small performances and interactions taking place, with no sound baffling.    

The piece we are looking for must be:   
>Durational;    
>For a group audience that can come and go;    
>Able to co-exist with other pieces – so neither loud (preferably unamplified), nor overly sensitive to external noise spill.
