*Qasim Riza Shaheen invites you to step into his world and experience his declarations of love and desire.*    

An entire show experienced at Contact in February 2012 has been reworked and condensed into a few static moments, declarations and an unexpected intervention. Qasim Riza Shaheen's *Misplaced Memoirs* features Zaf Shabir. Limited one-on-one encounters.
