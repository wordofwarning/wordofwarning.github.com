#### More         
*A man at work. A man playing. A man playing at being a man. A woman too.*         
         
Alister and Kat have been thinking about men and power. Aspirations and expectations. Sheds and tea. Mouth-watering barbecues. Vulnerability and sheer hard work.          
         
*Manpower* is a celebration of everyday maleness. A conversation. A tribute. A DIY project. A DJ set. A healthy dose of nostalgia.           
          
A navigation through culture and people and becoming ourselves.          
         
#### Who are they?        
Two Destination Language make contemporary performance that's beautiful, arresting and accessible; sometimes it's called theatre, sometimes live art, sometimes dance theatre — Word of Warning most recently presented their heartfelt [*Near Gone*](/archive/2014-spring/2destlang) in 2014.                
         
Led by artists Katherina Radeva and Alister Lownie, their work explores questions of identity, belonging and culture; as a Bulgarian and a Scot working together, they use their own histories and experiences to explore these ideas.            
          
UK-based, they are currently resident Company at Salisbury Arts Centre and supported artists at The Point, Eastleigh. *Near Gone* won them a Total Theatre Award for Innovation, Experimentation & Playing With Form, and the Pulse Ipswich Suitcase Prize.
