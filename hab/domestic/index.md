**Autumn 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes…       
        
**In Autumn 2015, Domestic II** will be unleashed on a new tower block in a new location somewhere in the Manchester conurbation; this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment, we will be occupying a space in transition: not quite a building-site, not quite a home…   
    
The open call for proposals is now closed.  We had 101 proposals in total and we are currently working our way through them.    
      
Check back at [domesticmcr.org](http://www.domesticmcr.org) in early September for the programme.    

It will be rough, it will be low-tech, it will be unpredictable! To get a feel for it, have a look at [2013's image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).
