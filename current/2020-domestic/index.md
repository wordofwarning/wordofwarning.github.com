#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For this new series of Domestic "at homes", we invited six artists to try out new works about what's on their minds — using whatever resources they have to hand…         
        
>*A chat on a hill above the city;<br>The highs and lows of romance in lockdown;<br>A DNA test, a dead bird, and a misjudged identity;<br>Wash your hands and business as usual;<br>When I think of home;<br>The space between us will not be televised.*           
          
Real lives, real stories, real homes.          
          
#### Programme         
Afreena Islam · *Letterbox Bumboy*       
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash your hands and business as usual.        
        
Alex Bradley · *The space between us will not be televised*       
&nbsp;&nbsp;…an action in support of those fighting for their lives in whatever context.        
        
Cheryl Martin · *When I Think Of Home*                  
&nbsp;&nbsp;'*I will sing and talk. As ever. But I'll probably ask you all a question, and try to get you to answer in the chat — if you're brave enough.*'        

Emma Geraghty · *a view from the temple*           
&nbsp;&nbsp;'*There's a pretty big hill near my house with a good view of the city.*'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'*Come and sit on a bench with me, and let's have a chat.*'        
         
Levantes Dance Theatre · *Canapé Domestic*        
&nbsp;&nbsp;A quirky act about the highs + lows of romance during lockdown…        
        
Nathan Birkinshaw · *(working title)*         
&nbsp;&nbsp;A DNA test, a dead bird, and a misjudged show about identity from someone who has no business making one.
