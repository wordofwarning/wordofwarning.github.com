Following [**DivergencyMcr**](http://divergencymcr.posthaven.com) — a [Creative Case NORTH](http://www.zendeh.com/blog/#announcement) residency exploring diversity in live art and contemporary performance, undertaken by [hÅb](/hab) + [STUN](http://stunlive.com) (Sustained Theatre Up North) — we are delighted to have received Grants for the Arts funding to continue the project.        
          
During 2015/16 Divergency organised a series of meals, discussions, workshops, sharings and performances with a group of local artists and a series of visiting artists — the first public performance being [Ria Hartley](/archive/2015-springsummer/hartley)'s *Matilda and Me* on 25 June 2015 in STUN's Studio; coming soon is an [evening of the different](/current/2016-divergency) at Z-arts (incl. STUN Studio) on 6 October 2016, 6-10pm.
