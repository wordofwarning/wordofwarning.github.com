A unique and humorous exploration of the (un)employment situation in the UK today. Expect song, satire and a sharing of stories.    

*We all know someone who's on the dole. Your dad's on the dole. Your dog's on the dole. You're probably on the dole, aren't you? Or even worse, maybe you have a job....* 

See Sh!t Theatre before they hit the big time. Or have to go work at Poundland.                   

*'Wonderfully politically incorrect and insightful...a cracking showcase for Mothersole and Biscuit's weighty talents'* WhatsOnStage.com
