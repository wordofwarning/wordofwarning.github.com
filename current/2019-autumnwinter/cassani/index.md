#### Who is he?        
Tom Cassani returns to parts-Mancunian after his [deceptive exposé of deception itself](/archive/2017-worksahead/cassani) in Works Ahead 2017. A Performance Artist and Liar, he is interested in how he can use elements of deception, misdirection and lying in his artistic practice. He has trained in sleight of hand, misdirection and stage magic, and now uses these skills to explore truth, honesty, and the importance of remaining wary of those who make extraordinary claims.
