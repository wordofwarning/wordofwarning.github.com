*How often do you talk to teenagers that you don't know? How do you think you may see the world differently if you did?*     

A one-on-one performance that creates a safe space where you can walk and talk with a teenager you've never met before; ask the questions that you've always wanted to ask, whilst also putting your heads together to solve the problems of the world.

Rediscover the honesty of youth and challenge yourself to be optimistic enough to see the world through teenage eyes.

Small Things is a company making creative adventures that revel in the challenge and joy of existence. They make inventive and beautifully crafted performances and playful experiences.
