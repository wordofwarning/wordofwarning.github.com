**Hidden Track ¦ *Told in Confidence***           
I am going to tell you a story that I never tell anyone. But it's okay to tell you, because I don't know who you are.             
An intimate performance for one (or two people) at a time, *Told in Confidence* is a gentle reflection on the taboos and stigma surrounding mental health. Through traditional storytelling and playful use of darkness and light, a space is created where secrets can be shared. Some things can only really be said to a stranger.

**J. Fergus Evans ¦ *She Sang Me To Sleep With It*** *(work in progress)*      
We all remember at least one song from our childhood — a lullaby our mother sang us, the theme song from our favourite tv show, the song we sang on road trips, the pop song our older sister taught us…        
Poet and performer J. Fergus Evans is asking you to teach him a song from your childhood over a cup of tea, and he might just give you something in return. And don't worry — he isn't a very good singer either.       
*She Sang Me To Sleep With It* was originally conceived at CAMPSITE 2014 with support from the Jerwood Charitable Foundation.

**Krissi Musiol ¦ *Making Time***    
Make something happen in one year or ten. I will deliver to your dedication. I will do my best to ensure it reaches you on time.   
A 6 minute one-to-one piece — about living, about doing, about not putting off tomorrow, about *Making Time* for all the things we want to do.      
Krissi Musiol is a North West based solo contemporary performance maker, writer and performer. Since 2004, she has been developing her own unique performance style, incorporating culture and identity, fusing together poetry and found materials, autobiographical experiences as well as themes of gambling, dancing and cake!
