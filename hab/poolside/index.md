**'Poolside Emergency** is the younger scouse sibling of [Emergency](/hab/emergency) â€” an occasional platform for live art + contemporary performance co-produced with + presented at the Bluecoat, Liverpool over the course of one day.    

Our **[third 'Poolside Emergency](/archive/2013-poolside)** took place on Saturday 13 April 2013, at the Bluecoat. To get a feel for it see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-poolside) + [image gallery](/galleries/2013-poolside).
