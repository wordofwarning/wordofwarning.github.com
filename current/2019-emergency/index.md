#### Saturday 21 September, 12noon-10pm. Pay What You Decide             
Manchester's twentieth annual manic micro-marathon of the bizarre + the beautiful: *copy??? from gallery to theatre, store-cupboard to stairwell*, some 30 live works in a travelling takeover of three Hulme venues…         
            
**During the daytime**, dip in and out of ongoing performances, installations + limited capacity experiences at NIAMOS; **in the evening**, join us for a series of short sit-down shows at STUN Studio + Z-arts. **Sample the different — then pay what you decide!**          
        
*Participating artists subject to change.*
