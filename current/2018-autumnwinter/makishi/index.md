#### More         
Part ritual; part prayer; part rowdy revivalist rally, *The Comforter* is a rite of passage that reclaims spirituality and proposes a new perspective on church. Exchanging psalms and sacrament for 80s/90s pop culture, it draws inspiration from *Twin Peaks* and Ingmar Bergman, and throws a kiss to George Michael.            
                   
*The Comforter* follows the powerfully moving and absurdly humorous *Vesper Time* ("a gorgeous hymn… for fearlessness, truth and love" — Exeunt): together they make up the first two of a three-show series about the Holy Trinity — *The Comforter* is the Holy Ghost of the trio, and asks the question: ‘What am I unwilling to feel?’                
           
Join Stacy to explore — through meditation, ritual, and disco — what it means to be fully alive and fully human.           
            
#### Who is she        
A multi-award winning artist who has been making work for 30 years.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
