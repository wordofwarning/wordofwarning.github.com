**idontloveyouanymore | *Move 37***         
Anna and David are in a relationship. For years they've been navigating each others' stuff, each others' malfunctions, from snoring to depression. In this performance they examine the thought patterns and the games in play within the corrupted systems of human relationships.             
**Anna + David** work together as idontloveyouanymore, partly to make sense of the absurdities around them, and partly so they don’t really have to leave the house. They also work with Theatre 42, who presented their award-winning show *Nothing is Coming, the Pixels are Huge* at [Emergency 2016](/archive/2016-emergency). They're supported by Lancaster Arts + Theatr Clwyd.
