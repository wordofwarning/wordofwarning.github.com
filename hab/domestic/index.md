**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes… See the [image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).         
         
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/archive/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on a new block of flats, this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment — Matthias Court (M3 6JD) was a space in transition — using only the top (15th) + ground floors over 3 nights + a day to show 17 pieces by artists including Leo Burtin, Ria Hartley, Catherine Hoffman, Cheryl Martin, Michael Pinchbeck + Louise Wallwein… See a rapid overview <a href="http://vimeo.com/143630694" target="_blank">on vimeo</a> + the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic).
