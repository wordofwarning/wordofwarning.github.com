*literal #37* is an active interpretation of the phrase "moving the goal posts".   

I will be moving goal posts.    

Inspired by Duchamp, Beuys and the complementary criticism *'I could do that'*, Martin Hamblen uses collage and cut'n'paste, installation, intervention, time-based media and performance. His practice is democratic and egalitarian in delivery and execution, reacting to and embracing the layperson's common criticism of contemporary art.
