##Stuart Silver    
####More    
Stuart Silver presents his ‘Big Picture’ monologue on getting perspective.  A philosophical almost-narrative of perilous received wisdoms and long-distance ambitions. With ukulele when you least expect it. And when you expect it.    

After a 10 year Bafta nominated, Perrier Award winning, collaboration with Kim Noble AS (nobleandsilver), Stuart Silver continues that partnerships’ tradition of crossing disciplines and entering new territories. After 2 highly successful runs at Soho Theatre, and shows at The Samuel Beckett Festival, The London Word Festival,  and Art Centres across the UK, this piece sees a technically stripped back, musical Stuart Silver.

*You Look Like Ants* is an intimate, humorous, tragi-ballad.  A conversational and textually rich epic journey where Stuart seeks to get a hold on what life is all about, under the crush of great advice.

##Tam Hinton    
####More    
A one-man show for all the lost and angry children of the world. Using video, claymation, and swearing, Mister Hinton will present a vision of the human soul in torment. Hooray!    

In a housing estate in a parallel universe, three intertwining characters struggle with their personal demons. Or are are they all the same demon? Only one way to find out...    
  
In the latest show from the outsider artists outsider artist, Hinton takes us on a trip into the diseased heart of modern England- via a rollercoaster ride along it’s furred up arteries on a collision course with its wildly malfunctioning pacemaker.    
 Expect laughter, tears, and a strange tingling sensation in your left earlobe.    

####Who is he?
Writer and performer Tam Hinton has spent years alienating and appalling people with his bitter, thwarted little stories. He writes plays and one-man shows, usually comical in nature but dealing with the evil sides of life.    

Hinton's first one-man show, *The Naked Soul of Kirk Godless*  took the 'best comedy' award at the Buxton  Festival in 2006. A mixture of live action storytelling and claymation, it examined ways in which the internet may be mutating human intelligence- and sexuality. It also contained plasticine pornography.     

Winner of the Manchester-not-part-festival fringe 'best play' award
