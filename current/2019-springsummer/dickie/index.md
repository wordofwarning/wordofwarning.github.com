*Presented by* Word of Warning       
         
#### In Brief      
A 90-minute mix of jungle music, theatre, spoken word and ritual.

A live documentary played out in the dance.  A personal story on E’s and Euphoria.

It’s not what you think – This is something you never raved to before.

Incorporating immersive theatre, dance and spoken word within a DJ set, The Rave Space deconstructs the DJ’s role as a status symbol, creating an authentic nightclub experience that is at once intimate and transcendent.
