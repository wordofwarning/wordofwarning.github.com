**Hazard** is our biennial micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance, blurring the boundaries between art and activism… Over 80 artists have taken to the streets of Manchester including: Action Hero, Alex Bradley, Jordan Mackenzie, Juliann O’Malley, Katherina Radeva, Michael Pinchbeck, Richard DeDomenici, Shahram Entekhabi + the vacuum cleaner.        
        
Our [fifth Hazard](/current/2014-hazard) popped up in Manchester's [St Ann's Square](http://bit.ly/1wrGmvW) and surrounding streets on Saturday 12 July 2014. For a glimpse of previous outbreaks of hazardous behaviour see 2012's [programme](/archive/2012-hazard) + [image gallery](/galleries/2012-hazard).         
              
So far we’ve wrapped Cathedral Gardens in fluttering hazard tape, pitted together a lion and a unicorn, moved the goalposts (literally) and witnessed flat packed children take over the streets of Manchester — oh, and conducted a hoola-hoopathon; The Larks had the public riddling, racing and chasing as urban archaeologists and private investigators, injecting mass gaming into St Ann’s Square and beyond.
