*A free afternoon of incidental intervention and sited performance in Mcr City Centre, presented by Word of Warning on Saturday 9 July: turn up at any time from 12 noon to 5pm and discover activity around <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUP9hOfLluWs.kfWwdpVK74IU" target="_blank">St Ann's Square</a>…*            
         
**There There | *Text HOME***          
*Text HOME to 78070* is a durational performative invasion of immigration advice. It sees two stereotypical Eastern Europeans occupy public spaces to distribute first-hand tips on everything from getting a work permit to navigating the NHS, helping immigrants integrate and endanger the British way.         
         
*Text HOME to 78070* is the brainchild of There There, a 100% Eastern European performance company conjured up by Dana Olărescu + Bojana Janković. Originally commissioned by Giving in to Gift.         
         
**Output Arts | *Running with Scissors***         
Output Arts presents the ultimate in hazardous track games: *Running with Scissors* gives you the opportunity to really test your metal. Fabulous prizes to be won!         
         
Output Arts produces playful and poignant site-specific installations: drawing with light under a flyover; searching for stories of loss on the beach with mumbling metal detectors; a motion-triggered ringing WWII telephone in a shopping centre.

**Dominique Baron-Bonarjee | *Collapse Manchester***             
A series of bodies appears, dotted around the urban landscape. Each body is falling, falling so slowly as to be barely visible. A vertical collapse set against the rapid flow of a linear city: a human measure of time and a reflection on presence and on time itself.           
*Collapse* is an ongoing series of performance interventions that place the 'body as measure'; *Collapse Manchester* creates a new landscape of stillness in the daily rush.       
           
**Jin Bells | *Head in Hole 2016***         
A pointless body, a meaningless action, a nonsensical intervention into the city...     
         
Emerging Manchester artist Jin Bells works between theatre and performance art and has undertaken a residency at CRASH2016 and has upcoming performances at Islington Mill, Salford and Tempting Failure Festival, London.              
            
**Vivian Chinasa Ezugha | *Because of hair; the dichotomy of culture and identity***           
*I am not historical, I am not futuristic, I am not the old nor am I the new. I am but an object made from human hair. My purpose is to disturb, to interrupt your contemplation and seduce your vision; so that I become an image of your imagination.*

Vivian Chinasa Ezugha makes work that attempts to connect to her Nigerian culture and to the questions she is asking about her identity as a black woman living in England.       
"*A raw unedited power, too distinct to miss. Charged and alive, Ezugha's presence irrepressibly seeps through her skin into every action, imbuing them with strong personal, political and cultural significance.*" — Zierle & Carter
