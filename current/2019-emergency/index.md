*Presented by* Word of Warning *in association with* NIAMOS, STUN *+* Z-arts           
         
#### Saturday 21 September, 12noon-10pm. Pay What You Decide             
Manchester's twentieth annual manic micro-marathon of the bizarre and the beautiful: this year spreading its wings across two Hulme buildings — the decaying splendour of NIAMOS and the familiar turf of STUN + Z-arts. From stage to stairwell, dress circle to box office, some 34 live works in a travelling takeover…            
            
**During the daytime**, dip in and out of ongoing performances, installations + limited capacity experiences at NIAMOS; **in the evening**, join us for a series of short sit-down shows at STUN Studio + Z-arts. **Sample the different — then pay what you decide!**

#### What people have said about Emergency         
>• *Fresh, exciting, unpredictable, mixed and provocative. Rewarding, too!*<br>• *I am amazed they manage so many shows in a day…*<br>• *The diversity is outstanding and so inclusive of all.*<br>• *Really important event for NW artists — safe space to experiment.*<br>• *Performances are both rewarding in their own right, and also offer a glimpse into where theatre might go in our more interactive and interconnected world.*<br>• *Thought provoking & frankly unique. It sets Manchester apart.*<br>[Audience Feedback from Emergency 2018](/archive/2018-emergency)/[2017](/archive/2017-emergency)/[2016](/archive/2016-emergency)/[2015](/archive/2015-emergency)
