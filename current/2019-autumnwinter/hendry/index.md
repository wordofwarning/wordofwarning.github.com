A funny and inspiring show exploring the hurdles on the way to the starting line, *Tetra-Decathlon* mixes humorous storytelling with athletic physicality as Lauren runs, jumps, and throws herself into a world of serious amateurs and comedic coaches — where winning is not simply about crossing the line first.       

Lauren signed up to compete in the World UltraMulti-Event Championships, having never set foot on an athletics track before. Featuring running, hurdling, jumping and throwing, a tetra-decathlon is 14 kinds of daft. With athletic physicality, Tetra-Decathlon tells the story of the many hurdles en route to the start-line.

Directed by multi-award winner, Jenna Watt (Faslane, Flâneurs) and performed by Lauren Hendry, Tetra-Decathlon is a show for those who got picked last, but know there’s more to give.

#### What people have said about *Tetra-Decathlon*         
>*…a lovely, affecting piece on what it means to take on a seemingly outlandish task, to try, to fail, to try again.*<br><a href="http://www.fest-mag.com/edinburgh/theatre/review-tetra-decathlon-by-showroom" target="_blank">Fest Mag</a><br>*…Hendry’s simply structured but impressively sweaty 60 minutes asks some piercing questions about failure and success, amateur and professionals, being a hero and being a fool and why we keep going against all the odds. It may not leave you as breathless as its protagonist, but it does keep you gripped.*<br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/reviews/edinburgh-festival-2018-fringe-shows-review-lyn-gardner-everything-not-saved-lights-over-tesco-a8500736.html" target="_blank">Lyn Gardner, The Independent</a>
