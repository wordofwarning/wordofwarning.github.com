**Emma Geraghty | *Keep The Lights On***†<sup>18</sup>         
*What makes a fetish? What counts as "normal"? Is there anything worse than a baggy gimp suit?* This piece asks why we don't talk about sex and what would happen if we did.      
**Emma Geraghty** is a director and a writer of prose and performative text based in Manchester. Her work explores notions of queerness, sexuality, and body image.

**Frances Kay | *FK vs KT: The Showdown***<sup>18</sup>      
*FK and KT have spent time learning to grow, understand and respect each other. How quickly can they be ripped apart again?* Testing a devoted relationship and scrutinising life and addiction, this lively performance explores the artist’s connections to her working class background, gender identity and sweet sweet booooze...                    
**Frances Kay** is a solo performance artist exploring the effects of performance on the body and mind, using many disciplines such as endurance, duration, and self-inflicted pain. Her work includes strong visual aesthetics and currently explores issues of social interest, such as; gender politics, feminism, religion and personal suffering.

**Mark Croasdale | *Staying In - A Date with a Diary***†<sup>18</sup>         
*A shadowy figure sits waiting to meet you, longing for a connection, hoping for understanding. Can you reveal the person within? Experience an intimate, vulnerable moment with a stranger as you take a dive into their past through their real-life diaries.* Forming part of the wider *Staying In* project, inspired by the research of Stonewall, this work aims to explore identity, loneliness and belonging. Currently in-development with the support of The Lowry, Waterside, Contact and The Proud Trust.         
      
**Mark Croasdale** utilises a range of media according the specific needs, demands and context of each project. His work has spanned various art mediums and consists of visual installations and performance pop-ups including *Angels In Ancoats* and the immersive, audio installation *Anonymous*, *Sydney* and theatre work including *Lightspeed*, *Blink* and the multidisciplinary work *All About and To a Female Artist*. In 2017 he was commissioned by New Trust Art (National Trust), Waterside and Creative Industries Trafford to create the new work *Letters From Egypt*.

**Lise Boucon | *EAT ME (or the dream of a feast)***<sup>18</sup>         
*Welcome! Welcome to my feast. Please, take a seat / And please be patient, very patient. My feast takes time / Time for celebration, time for rejoicing, for joy we devour / We are waiting for the guests, but they are late in coming, or come some unexpected, with horns / And slowly, gently, they rise to the assault / The ritual is in progress. The feast begins / EAT ME.*       
I want this piece to be an allegory of the wish of disappearance, from a non-appropriate body/identity/society. Manipulating symbols and references in all white, this is a long and slow surrealist dream. Like a pagan ritual to be reborn to oneself…                    
               
**Lise Boucon** is a body-based performance artist of the extraordinary and extreme. Introspective and intriguing, she’s following a personal thread questioning mainly the social impact on the body.

**Luca Federici | *Glitters and Blood***<sup>18</sup>         
An exploration of sexuality and gender-fluidity in relation to the difficulty that some people have in accepting their self/sexuality – difficulty that is often related to fear of others. The action is also based upon the tradition of pain and blood sacrifice and focus on the concept of DEATH - TRANSIT - REBIRTH, where Pain and Death are seen as paths that lead to a new and pure life. By using BDSM techniques and fetishes, the work offers an esoteric, ritualistic action that reflects upon concepts related to gender-fluidity, struggle for self-acceptance and pain as a way to purification/ salvation. An intimate space where pain is seen as a path which leads to purification/acceptance of your true self.                 
      
**Luca Federici** was born in Pesaro (Italy), and trained in Fine Art, specialising in painting, and showed in exhibitions throughout Italy.  He currently lives in London where he graduated the MA Fine Arts at Chelsea College of Art and Design and where he experimented with performance and collage, performing at events like FUCK/LIVE/ART curated by Franko B at Mori + Stein Gallery, and fetish clubs such as Psycho Ward and Club DVS.

**Niya (a.k.a. Yani B) | *Collective Lover***<sup>18</sup>         
In their new work, Niya is inviting the audience to explore intimacy, gender and desire in a post-porn era of environmental destruction, food crisis and species loneliness.   Stemming from their previous work *Trans:plant* where the artist lived with a large gender-ambiguous family of Aloe Vera plants, the performance takes the form of a ceremony of tasting, sharing, stimulating and connecting, asking the question: *How does it feel to see the earth as a lover and not as a mother?*                  
        
**Niya (a.k.a. Yani B)** examines the body, in its presence or absence, as the central stage where the politics of identity are enacted. Experimenting with original creative processes and media they explore the body and its context, as a form of expression and manifestation of culture, ideology, gender, sexuality, social ethics and collective aspirations. Exhibitions include the International Print Biennale in Newcastle, the 5th Moscow Biennale for the group exhibition Biopolitics (2013), the 5th Thessaloniki Biennale,  for the group exhibition Identalterity, a series exhibited at Queer Art(ists) Now, (2017).

**Rosie Gibbens | *Auto Erotic Assimilation***<sup>18</sup>         
Part absurd product demonstration, part lacklustre burlesque show, *Auto Erotic Assimilation* presents an abstract orgy with everyday objects. The normal functions of the items are rejected and mundane routine is fetishised. The performance appropriates and combines images from advertising, customer service and pornography in an attempt to highlight and subvert presentations of women in these fields.                    
  
**Rosie Gibbens** is a performance and video artist interested by desire and power in relationship to gender performativity, sexual politics and consumerist identity. She has performed at multiple London venues including Toynbee Studios, Bow Arts and the Barbican.

**Tom Halls | *Play Thing***<sup>18</sup>         
*Ever wanted to be back in that place where you could play with your toys, letting your imagination run wild?* This is your chance. Except you're not a child and this isn't a toy. *Play Thing* puts you in control. The artist and audience relationship is flipped, turning the artist into the passive observer and muse for wherever your imagination may run. Sometimes the rules and politics of society constrict our creativity, with *Play Thing* the rules are left at the door. *Come and connect, make your masterpiece and create a living version of your imagination.*                  
        
**Tom Halls** is a performance artist, originally from Melbourne, Australia, now based in Manchester. Tom’s arts practice centres on creating works that challenge and test the relationship between audience and performer. Tom is co-founder of Hotel Now, a gloriously entertaining company focused on creating original Australian works and TomYumSim, a performance duo using unconventional performance spaces for immersive experiences.
