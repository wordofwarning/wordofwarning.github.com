**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids + their adults, adults + *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!         
       
### Haphazard 2019 — call for artists         
[hÅb](/hab)/[Word of Warning](/) + <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> are now calling for proposals for their **fifth Haphazard**: a FREE ‘all ages’ live art day taking place on **Saturday 27 April 2019, 12noon-3pm** in and around Manchester's Z-arts. **Save the date and get your thinking caps on!**         
         
To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; a singing fish and a sax-playing bear; paintball golf and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world… Get a feel for it with our [gallery of images](/galleries/2018-emergency) + [programme](/archive/2017-haphazard) from 2017, or delve further with a look at 2016's [images](/galleries/2016-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2016-haphazard), 2015's [images](/galleries/2015-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2015-haphazard), 2013's [images](/galleries//2013-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard).         
        
**This is not live art for children but live art for all ages — and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years — so work should have appeal for adults *and* children alike, even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!**        
            
From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement, and nothing too text-heavy. We have access to a variety of spaces throughout the Z-arts building: a café, an atrium, some small spaces, some stairwells, and a big black box. Durational, intervention, and ‘come + go’ work seems to work the best — we're *not* really looking for sit-down theatre shows. This isn't a really formal selection process with lots of criteria, but work does need to be legal, and you must have the right to perform it!        
         
So we can get all the info in one place, we'd be grateful if you could fill out the online <a href="http://habarts.wufoo.com/forms/haphazard-2019-proposal-form" target="_blank">Haphazard proposal form</a> **by Wednesday 27 February 2019, 5pm**, after which we'll let you know if you're on the list of possible projects and get in touch to take it from there — we aim to have made programming decisions by 15 March.
