*There's this man sat at a desk...*
*There's this man and he's not sat at a desk...*
*There are four men and one woman and they're sat on chairs...*    
*And then, there's You...*         

From moments of one-on-one intimacy to moments of a cacophony of ensemble wordplay, *The MOBB Project* playfully explores and exposes how we interact online. Expect some storytelling, some arguing and there might even be a bit of Sting... (yes, the musician)...    

*The MOBB Project* is a new collaboration between Bristol based theatre company Massive Owl and Newcastle-upon-Tyne based performance maker Jenny Duffy. For *Emergency*, Jenny and Massive Owl will be presenting an extract of the performance.
