### Artists in Alphabetical Order (*subject to change*)        
**Akeim Toussaint Buck | *Windows of Displacement***        
An autobiographically sourced solo, blending dance, song, and spoken word to explore personal narratives, ancestral memory, and the shifting (and increasingly urgent) politics surrounding the movement of people. It explores his own experience of displacement, coupled with historical and current political references. Aiming to create a story of the past, present and future of humanity, this marks Akeim's first work strictly for theatre settings.        
Choreographed + performed by Akeim Toussaint Buck. The development of *Windows of Displacement* is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England; further supported by Yorkshire Dance through the Amplified project, funded by Esmee Fairbairn Foundation.

**Ane Iselin Brogeland | *The Album of Love (an extract)***        
*I believe it is the time and space for some sweat, silver, and lots of love! Together we will be sharing a space we have all somehow visited in one way or another. It is extreme, it is painful, it is playful, and we get lost. It is love!*         
Using improvisation as a performance practice, *The Album of Love* researches the many different emotional states we go through while being in a relationship with another partner; mentally and physically. Turn 2017 presents an extract of the full length solo, which will premier on May 16th in Chester. Each different 'state of love' is connected to a certain song which has been specifically chosen for its lyrics, energy and emotional state; creating instant choreography on stage.        
Originally from Norway, **Ane Iselin Brogeland** studied in Denmark, Chester + Chichester. She has toured internationally with Jonathan Burrows, Bettina Carpi, Rick Nodine, Ofra Idel, and Lila Dance, and has been guest dancer for Flexer & Sandiland's *Disappearing Acts* in Norway.

**Giorgio de Carolis | *SAISERIT***

Tiresias was a prophet of Apollo in Greek mythology. He was blind and famous for his clairvoyance. He couldn't physically see but he could understand reality in its totality.<br>Saiserit stands for the opposite. Saiserit is ignorant of reality. Saiserit is not being able to see someone else's perspective. Saiserit is that *"close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up"* (D. F. Wallace).
