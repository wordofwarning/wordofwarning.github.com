*Presented by* Word of Warning + Z-arts
          
####In Brief
Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around this historic building – take a wander and see what you stumble upon... living geometric shapes making moon music, a bonkers bucket dance, marathon hula-hooping and bouncy, squeaky, ping-pong performers...    

Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft, this is a day for kids and their adults; adults and *their* adults – in short, anyone looking for a different day-out.    
Turn up at any time during the course of the day, come and go as you please - there will always be something to do or see.  Performances happen at least twice, and the full schedule will appear here the week commencing 4 Feb.    

In the café, expect Volkov Commanders' geometric orchestra, Rachael Nutter's carbon dioxide garden, Angel Club (north's) mischievous Mirror Twins and, upstairs, become contestants in Lydia Hirst's budget recreation of the iconic Crystal Maze gameshow... or take a journey of discovery on Ultra Violets' exploration of the hidden maze of Z-arts in search of a Minotaur on the prowl.    

In the Atrium meet Kitty, a hula-hooping maestro, or listen-in on a miniature highway of talking cars. Join a bonkers bucket dance in the rear atrium or take a half hour breather for whatsthebigmistry's Ping Pong Crash.  Throughout you will be welcomed by our friendly staff - if you need some help feel free to badger a badger, outfox fox a fox or just discover a duck.

Enter [*LABOLIS*](http://vimeo.com/33027206)…getting lost is just the beginning.   
A shape-shifting maze in an urban metropolis. Immersing players of all ages in fantasy spaces it seeks to test the wits and sharpen senses through fun and games. Come creep, sneak, frolic and guess your way through riddle-solving realms where live creatures roam, star’s will charm you with their stories and nothing is quite what it seems. This time, a Minotaur is on the prowl…    

*Synesthetic Moonscape* - [**Volkov Commanders**](http://www.volkovcommanders.co.uk): living geometric shapes making moon music.    
   
*Green, Gas, Grass* - **Rachael Nutter**    
It's hard to be glum in a garden green, with the squeakiest flowers you've ever seen
Where the sun shines bright all day long, qnd the grass grows round to the bird song
If you're feeling deflated by the cold outside, pop along to the balloon filled patch where I reside.    

*The Mirror Twins* - [**Angel Club (north)**](http://www.angelclubnorth.com)    
Taking the weight from your shoulders and transporting you to exotic climes in this head to head encounter of canapé art - these 'talking heads' will amaze and amuse...

*Wildlife* - [**Lani Irving**](http://laniirving.wix.com/laniirving)    
It is little known that Manchester is home to some of the most remarkable wildlife in the world. In recent months there have been sightings of dandy wolves, busy badgers, socially awkward foxes and the odd commuting duck… If you’re lucky, maybe you will catch a glimpse of some of these bizarre creatures going about their business, or even discover a previously unseen species!    

*Kitty Has No Pity* - [**Katherina Radeva**](http://www.katherinaradeva.co.uk)    
A nostalgic look at those lost childhood and childish moments of playful learning, exercising and gaming. Throwing caution to the wind, all are urged to take up the hoop and join in the games.   

*Bucket Dance* - [**Robert Foster** ](http://vimeo.com/25026289) - A Bauhaus inspired parody    

*Ping Pong Crash and other sounds* - [**whatsthebigmistry**](http://www.whatsthebigmistry.com)    
A small orchestra of bodies and objects and an assemblage of quirksome movements 
The space is about to go off with a performance of falling, inflating and pushing - everything has a place but who knows where it will land!    

*Car Conversations* - [**Forecast**](http://www.forecastdance.org/car_conversations.html)    
A tiny motorway of overhead conversations sweeps round the Z-arts atrium.    

####Plus: Haphazard discussion, 4pm
An informal chance to meet the artists and to discuss art that can bridge the generation gap.  What different responses does the same work provoke and what can we, as adults, learn from how kids watch performance?
