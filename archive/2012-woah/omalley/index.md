####Who is she? 

Julieann O’Malley actually lives under two different identities and always lies about her age… she suffers with Automatonophobia.     

####What people have said about her 

>Julieann O’Malley makes live performance installations & video work that's raw, visceral emotionally charged, resonant, questioning, poignant, mesmerizing & evocative. - *Robyn Woolston – Artist.*    

####Works Ahead:Interactions

A journey around the hidden spaces of a theatre - one monumental installation, three intimate encounters... 

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-long *maze of performance*: [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/).  Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing emergency accommodation artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
