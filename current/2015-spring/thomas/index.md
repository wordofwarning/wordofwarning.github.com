####More            
A tale of hubris, planes, demos and undercover deceit told by an award-winning performer. Ten years ago an activist and close friend of Mark's was exposed as a spy for BAE Systems, infiltrating the movement. Now Mark wants to find him and has some questions to ask. This is a true story.          
              
*Cuckooed* picks up from where the award-winning *Bravo Figaro* left off in style, using interviews from friends, colleagues, activists and journalists to examine the impact of betrayal. It is a personal and timely tale that tries to unearth what it means to be spied upon by a corporation under the sanction of the state.            
              
Winner of a *Scotsman Fringe First (2014)* and *Amnesty International Freedom of Expression* awards, expect plenty of laughs, some weird characters, documentary styles, probably a tear or two, and the vague possibility that Mark might get beaten up in the process of making it as he tries to find out if he wants revenge — or if he can forgive a friend.             
              
####Who is he?              
Mark Thomas is a writer, activist and comedian known for his incisive wit and political awareness. Since his first stand-up gig in a pub in Putney in 1985, his consistently varied output has included: six series of *The Mark Thomas Comedy Product* on Channel 4; various Radio 4 broadcasts, including 2007's Sony Award-winning [*My Life in Serious Organised Crime*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/markthomas.shtml); regular contributions to [*The New Statesman*](http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/mark_thomas); formerly holding a Guinness World Record for "Most Number of Political Demonstrations in 24 Hours"; and 2013/14's [*100 Acts of Minor Dissent*](http://twitter.com/100acts), which included taking the police to court over surveillance and finding a new definition for the word ["farage"](http://100acts.org.uk/farage).
              
Now one of comedy's elder statesmen, in 2011/12 Mark created his first theatre show, [*Bravo Figaro*](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/bravo-figaro-by-mark-thomas) — a touching and poignant tale about his opera-loving father and their relationship (and how Mark came to book Royal Opera House singers in his parent's bungalow); it won his first *Scotsman Fringe First* award and was [broadcast on Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rl708) in 2013.
