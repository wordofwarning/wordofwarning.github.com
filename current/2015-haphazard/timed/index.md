####1-3pm + 3-3.10pm performance		
**Liz Clarke | *My Inflatable One***		
A cross between a rubbery, exploding, all ages 'sewing bee' and an odd, deconstructed, cabaret encounter… At times spectators, at times involved, the audience share in a collective experience. Part mundane, part spectacle, part wonderment — this encounter charts the quest for *Bigger! Better! More!*, all told through the medium of balloons and silly soundtracks.
	
Liz's performance practice is mostly body-based, exploring the boundaries between live art, theatre and cabaret, between gender, and between reality and dream-scapes. Shows include *I Tattooed My Baby* (she didn’t) and *Cannonballista*, a dark human cannonball show (she did), as well as many durational and shorter cabaret works.
