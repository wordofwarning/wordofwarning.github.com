#### In Brief      
One woman's memories of the home where she grew up. Populated by stories of communism, war, merriment and family, she shapes a world from paper and picture as she seeks the father she has lost.

#### More         
>*We are all ageing. As I write this, and as you read it. Time passes.*          
         
A woman returns to visit her childhood home and misses the one thing she values most: the father she remembers.          
         
*Declining Solo* is about the relationship between a father and daughter, between a person and their culture. It's about migration and home, and what it means to belong in a place. It's about who we are.         
          
Memories, folklore, political turmoil and family history combine in a celebration of life and our shared stories.         
         
>*It's in a place where there's singing and dancing and eating and drinking and being merry, of friendships and familial links as the core of communities.<br>It's in a place where the summer smells of sun, and the winter smells of burning coal.<br>I think if I piece it back together somehow…<br>If the vase has been broken and I put back the pieces, it can get better.*        
         
#### Who are they        
Two Destination Language make contemporary performance that's beautiful, arresting and accessible; sometimes it's called theatre, sometimes live art, sometimes dance theatre — Word of Warning most recently presented their Brexit-triggered [*Manpower*](/archive/2016-autumnwinter/2destlang) in 2016 and heartfelt [*Near Gone*](/archive/2014-spring/2destlang) in 2014.                
         
Led by artists Katherina Radeva and Alister Lownie, their work explores questions of identity, belonging and culture; as a Bulgarian and a Scot working together, they use their own histories and experiences to explore these ideas.            
          
UK-based, they are currently resident Company at Salisbury Arts Centre and supported artists at The Point, Eastleigh.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won’t turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don’t often have to disappoint people but if we can’t fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
