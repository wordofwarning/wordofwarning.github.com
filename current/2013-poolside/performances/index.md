**Kitty Graham | The Bare Earth**    
Using a bed of earth “ this place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other “ the piece explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.    

**Sarah Grainger-Jones | Soliloquy**    
A solo performance exploring the futility of language in the face of loss.  The piece references death, mediumship and the struggle to communicate silence    

**Sophie Nathan | 	Lucky Me**    
A site-specific performance piece, which explores success, status and commodification of identity. The performance operates by re-enacting œtrophy-momentsù we may aspire to, things we have always wanted to achieve.    

**Fiona Anderson | Sweet Nothings**    
Fiona Anderson is currently in her final year of study at Edinburgh College of Art, within the Intermedia department.  'Sweet Nothings', furthers these investigations into internalized social norms, focusing on views of how to be in love.    
**Moreno Solinas |	URANUS**
