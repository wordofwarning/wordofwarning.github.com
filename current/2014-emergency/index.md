*Presented by* Word of Warning, STUN + Z-arts          

####Saturday 4 October 2014, 12noon-11pm             
**Manchester's marathon micro-festival returns for its fifteenth year — the bizarre, the bold + the beautiful dotted around this historic building.**       
          
Last year we taped performers to windows, played a uniquely guttural rendition of Nessun Dorma and unearthed a viscerally prehistoric woman. This year will be an equally eclectic performance lucky-dip — your chance to sample the different and all for free.         

Drop-in for ten minutes or stay for the full eleven hours — a free day-out for the curious with xxx new works; featuring artists (subject to change):
