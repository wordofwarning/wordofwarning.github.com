**Works Ahead** is a new-ish project, developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes we ran with greenroom. Started in 2012, it aims to offer very small supported work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events. Support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work…       
        
The **[first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah)** took place in May/June 2012, with a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production) featuring a night of performances from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol; and an evening of interactions from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
The **[second Works Ahead](/archive/2013-worksahead)** took place in May 2013, once more at Contact, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 Turn Prize*); and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre + Wayne Steven Jackson… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
The **[third Works Ahead](/archive/2014-worksahead)** took place in May 2014 at Contact, with a triple-bill of work that delved into the mindset of the performer from Lindsay Bennett, Paul O'Donnell + SheepKnuckle… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2014-woah).        
        
Our **[fourth Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead)** took place in April 2015 at Contact, with a double-bill from Nathan Birkinshaw + Jamil Keating: two young male artists questioning manliness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2015-woah).          
           
Our **[fifth Works Ahead](/current/2016-worksahead)** takes place 3+4 June 2016 at Contact, with two very different double bills from four artists at different stages in their careers: Terri Donovan + Afreena Islam; Top Joe + Lucy McCormick. Different stages, different scales, still Works Ahead…             
          
Works Ahead 2016 is commissioned and produced by hÅb and Contact; supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council. Project Mentor: Peader Kirk
