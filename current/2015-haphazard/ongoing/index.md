**Leo Burtin | *Homemade: Le Bistroquet***      
You are invited to Leo's Bistro for an apéritif! Join us in this pop-up social space where the menu needs you! While you're sipping on a lemonade and tasting a delightful piece of quiche, why not contribute your own recipe for the establishment's chef to consider? *Le Bistroquet* is a pop-up intervention [last seen at Hazard 2014](/archive/2014-hazard/ongoing), devised and hosted by Leo Burtin, and produced by Talk with LEAP as part of the Homemade series.        
**N.B.** Food and drink served may contain allergens.       
        
Leo Burtin is an artist and creative producer whose work sits at the crossroads where genres and disciplines meet, blend and blur. Leo's practice is primarily collaborative, and has recently involved engaging in conversation with strangers a lot. Both as an artist and producer he has worked with Rajni Shah, Blast Theory, imitating the dog and shown work internationally. He wouldn't normally let you know that he is French and used to work for Jamie Oliver.

**Josh Coates | *The White Room***       
A small, cupboard-like room is covered in white paper: walls, floor, chairs, furniture… You are invited to leave something(s) in the room by writing or drawing wherever you want — let something go, get something off your chest or something that has been bugging you for a while, leave something for someone to find later on like a phone number or maybe a compliment…

**Lani Irving | *Wildlife***        
Last seen during [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard), Lani Irving brings along a friendly herd of cows to herd you around the building – and if you need any help they might moo back!

**Julieann O’Malley | *HIVE***          
Are young people encountering the natural word outside, the way that they used to? Are they aware about the struggling Bee species, and that if we loose this hearty worker we'll loose two thirds of our fresh fruit and vegetables?          
        
An interactive environment where young people are transported in to the centre of a Queen Bee's *HIVE*, submerged into the middle to be greeted by the Queen herself — who will show and tell about her home and what goes on there. She's hospitable and friendly but looking for solutions, do you think you could help?
