####In Brief                      
The true story of Louise’s first two meetings with her birth mother, three decades after being offered for adoption. Allowing the audience to share both the intimacy of their private first reunion, and also their public second meeting while she was on stage, the story puts fierce independence and emotional vulnerability alongside each other.    

Directed by Susan Roberts.
