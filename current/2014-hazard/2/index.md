**Bingo Meg + Disco Jazz | *Carboot Disco Bingo***        
An interactive experience — part dance-lesson, part party, part performance, part bingo. Essentially it's an elaborate game of bingo combined with the magic of disco, think Henry Ford meets Donna Summer down the gala! C'mon disco dogs, get your groove on!        
        
Megan Clark-Bagnall + Jasmine Loveys are Bristol-based independent artists, establishing *Carboot Disco Bingo* for Punchbowl Festival in 2012 — it has since toured the UK performing at festivals, art centres and Danny Boyle’s Shuffle Film Festival; in June 2013 they created and delivered several craft stations and *Carboot Disco Bingo* workshops for The Royal Shakespeare Company during their summer family festival. Jasmine makes solo performance, happenings, and interactive experiences; Megan likes making sculptural objects, installations, immersive art forms and live art.

**Nicola Canavan | *MILK***            
Isaiah 66:10-13 *“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees."*    
             
Nicola Canavan’s practice is rooted in action-based performance and spans live work, documentations of its products + traces, and the re-presentation of these in other forms. Born in North East England, Canavan performs and shows work nationally and internationally within programmes such as performance space (London), In Between Time (Bristol), City of Women (Ljubljana), SPILL National Platform (Ipswich). She recently won the Artsadmin Bursary, Artist International Development fund and the UNLIMITED R&D Bursary.

####2.30-2.50pm        
**Antje Hildebrandt | *You Make Me Want To Lose You***        
An experimental investigation into the human relationship between body and its surroundings. The performance plays in the here and now, with moments of stillness and movement, intimacy and publicity. The dancers cannot see but must negotiate themselves together and alone in a strange environment. In this playful and risky act of exploration the performers subtly interact with their surroundings — evoking moments of surprise, empathy and wonder.        
        
Performers: Martha Passakopoulou + Rosalie Wahlfrid.
