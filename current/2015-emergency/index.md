###Saturday 3 October 2015, 12noon-10pm. FREE             
**Manchester's manic micro-marathon of the bizarre + the beautiful celebrates sweet sixteen — from gallery to theatre, store-cupboard to stairwell, some 26 live works in a non-stop performance takeover.**         
         
From noon, dip in and out of ongoing performances — from virtual reality to physical anxiety — all over the building: a couple defy the sands of time, grain by grain; a man elevates the humble cabbage to the heights of celebrity; and a woman bends, literally, under the strain…           
         
Then from 4pm join us for a series of short sit-down shows in a variety of spaces — from stand-up with a twist, to a manic roller derby and a raunchy celebratory climax.         
         
Your chance to sample the different — all for free, featuring (*participating artists subject to change*):
