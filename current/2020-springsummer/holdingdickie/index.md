#### More         
*No lights. No music. No props. Moving. And speaking. And moving and speaking. And Skanking and moving and speaking. Some nodding. Pulsing. Also bopping. And shaking. And shaking shaking. Scrambling. And speaking. And pointing.<br><br>Pointing at the space when others see my face.<br>Pointing at addiction and how that makes us who we are.<br>Pointing at divorce and how that makes us who we are.<br>Pointing at Britain and old actors and privilege and how that makes me who I am.<br>Pointing at the Sun and speaking about white golden things.*        
        
Today, Britain continues to benefit from its colonial past. A nation passionately caught up with being right, being the exception to the rule, and making profit at any cost. Children of divorced parents are 50% more likely to develop mental health problems. Addiction is a primary cause of preventable death; ruining lives, and consuming vast amounts of medical resources.           
         
Will is white, British, straight, and privately educated. He grew up in a wealthy suburb inside the M25 and now lives in a Victorian house in Liverpool. Divorced parents; addictions to food, exercise, and attention.<br>Is there a way of coming to terms with this identity, this past, and his privilege?<br>Any hope? Any space for a voice and moving body beyond a maelstrom of inequality?
