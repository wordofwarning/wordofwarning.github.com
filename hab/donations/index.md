If you like what we do, you can support us in a number of ways:       
**by <a href="http://eepurl.com/i_Odb" target="_blank">signing-up to receive our Weekly Warning emails</a>**         
or        
**by [coming along to Word of Warning events](/)**        
or         
**by <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E" target="_blank">making a donation</a>**         
          
All donations, no matter how small, are very welcome. So if you've a lonely fiver going begging, then why not give it a good home? We will put it to very good use — supporting artists and interesting nights out in Manchester.       
           
We're sure we don't need to preach about straitened times, and the onus on the arts to prove its worth and to attract private giving; however, <a href="http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126-Peter-Philips-philanthropy-in-the-regions.pdf" target="_blank">with 70% of all philanthropy going to London organisations</a>, and without a building of our own to focus attention, a small peripatetic organisation like hÅb needs all its supporters' help.       
           
So, to help us demonstrate we're 'doing our bit', please click <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E" target="_blank">here</a> or drop a couple of coins in a collecting tin at one of our free/PWYD events.            
         
**All web donors are sent an exclusive personalised laminate to say thanks!**
