####In Brief
A field test to pull your eyes to the periphery and the wilderness beyond.   
Durational, from sunset every night, this 'depth of field' illusion nestles amidst trees, forming a hidden landscape made immersive by sound — a moment of rural tranquility amidst urban chaos.    

Coming to life at dusk, *Field Test in Garageland* is experienced by looking out from within an empty garage, immersing its audience in a world far from its building-site surroundings.    
            
**Please note: this piece takes place in an unheated garage, wrap up warm!**

####More      
Originally a work for a rural glade, here *Field Test* has been reimagined to offer respite in a more urban setting. The piece is composed of an array of over 500 solar-powered LEDs and a four speaker synchronised surround-sound.    

*"My family suffer from cataracts, a blurring of the vision. I haven’t personally suffered from this condition as yet, but I have taken the Humphries Field Test 6 times. This simple test examines your peripheral vision.”*    

*Field Test* is an explosion of this test; an artistic extension of the bio-medical examination, a way of recalibrating our viewpoint to the outskirts, or the edgelands, into the darkness and wilderness where glow worms insist we move on. *Field Test* uses remote speakers, LEDs, and nightfall to entice an audience into a collective 'test' of their senses, to take their senses literally to the edge and then beyond.    
                  
####Who are they?    
Alex Bradley (UK) is a Bristol-based sound and performance artist creating large-scale immersive sound works including *Whiteplane_2*, described as 'beautiful and disorientating' (The Observer). A former Cooper House resident and greenroom regular, last seen in Manchester as one half of the [GO Project](/archive/2012-autumnwinter/goproject/index.html), *Field Test in Garageland* marks his return to his home of more than a decade ago.   

Scott Smith (US) is a Kansas-born musician, a player of the steel guitar resonant with the feeling of belonging to absolute wilderness, of single railway tracks cast into the desert.
