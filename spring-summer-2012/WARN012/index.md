####In Brief
*Cheeky, thought-provoking and sometimes raunchy sprees of eccentricity.*

Manchesterâ€™s micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance returns for its fourth outing - chance encounters, random occurrences and risky ventures around and about the city centre.

The call for artist proposals is now live at [hazardmcr.org](http://hazardmcr.org)   

We are also looking for supporters to help us realise this event - so if you'd like to make a contribution please have a look at our pitch at [Sponsume](http://www.sponsume.com/project/hazard-2012)
