#### More         
In 2015 Greater Manchester Police recorded the UK's 2nd highest rate of hate crime — with the number of disablity motivated crimes more than doubling since 2014. *Shadow Girl — the city streets* is a creative response to this, aiming to make people living with disability labels more visible on our streets…         
           
*Shadow Girl — the city streets* is about a girl that has become afraid of people and become a shadow of herself as result of the things people say about her. She can hear and understand the things that are said, and every time she hears hurtful words they chip away a little bit of her light.          
         
Sometimes it's more than words, and people are often fearful of making themselves visible or going outside.              
          
#### Who is she           
Chrissy Jones is a Manchester-based artist living with a Learning Disability Label. She is a long standing artist with Proud & Loud Arts and has recently been working with The Lowry, DIY + Access all Areas in *MADHOUSE re:exit*, performed in Manchester's Barton Arcade.          
              
*Shadow Girl* is her first solo work, originally developed as part of Proud & Loud Arts’ group work *Cells – A Body of Work*, here expanded and developed on a larger scale for Hazard 2018. In *Shadow Girl — the city streets*, Chrissy wants to bring a positive discussion about learning disability to a wider public audience through a creative intervention in public spaces.
