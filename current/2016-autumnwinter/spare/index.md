#### More      
Read Sarah Walters article on *HUG* in the <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/hug-whitworth-thursday-lates-standen-11155335" target="_blank">Manchester Evening News</a>.             

Unable to visually gauge their surroundings, participants experience the performance through sound, breath and vibrations of the body as the choir of voices deliver the song. Playing with sense and perspective, *HUG* is a unique examination of the human voice's power.        

*HUG* is currently touring the UK and internationally following critically acclaimed performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Southbank Centre, London. For Manchester and Preston it brings together a brand new ensemble of local voices for three days only.          

#### Who is she?     
Bristol-based, Verity Standen trained in music at Dartington College of Arts; her work as a composer, musical director and performer explores the human voice and how it can be celebrated and transformed through live performance.            

In addition to her solo work and running her choir (Utterance) she regularly collaborates with a range of artists and companies across the UK, also as an outside eye + ear, vocal coach, facilitator and lecturer. Her current composition projects include *Medusa* (Bristol Old Vic) + *The Light Princess* (Tobacco Factory Theatres), and she has been nominated for an Off West End Award, The Arches Brick Award and a Total Theatre Award.           

#### What people have said about *HUG*        
>*To feel somebody's thorax vibrate as they tackle an elaborate countermelody feels like the most immediate, visceral experience of music as human expression possible… like an antenna to heaven.*<br><a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/hug-review" target="_blank">★★★★★ TimeOut</a>        
>*…there is more to it than just sensation. …a strangely cathartic experience, unequivocally illustrating the power that music holds to move us.*<br><a href="http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/mmm-hmmm-hug/" target="_blank">Exeunt</a>        
>*…the sound rose and fell in waves until it felt as if I was drenched in music that had seeped its way into every organ in my body, and maybe even found my soul. The enforced intimacy of the piece is startling, initially discomforting, charged and ultimately liberating. You can't help but feel better after experiencing it.*<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2014/aug/08/edinburgh-festival-2014-new-levels-intimacy-verity-standen" target="_blank">Lyn Gardner, The Guardian</a>
