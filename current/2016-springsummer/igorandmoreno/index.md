####In Brief      
There are two people in this dance performance, but it is not just about them. It is about all of us. It is about the secret lives we all possess when we are close to others. It is about those moments – between coffee and dancing – when harmony abandons us and all we have left is the desire to scream. It is a performance and place to imagine how things might be other than the way they are. It is a simple room for all our tomorrows.

>*Warped and explicit, it is very much not for the faint-hearted. It is also one of the oddest, funniest, saddest hours of comedy I ve seen.*<br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/reviews/kim-noble-you-re-not-alone-soho-theatre-review-a-show-that-runs-on-surprise-and-shock-10036119.html" target="_blank">Alice Jones, The Independent</a>
