**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes…       
        
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/current/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on Matthias Court, a new tower block in a new location in the Manchester conurbation (M3 6JD); this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment, we occupied a space in transition: not quite a building-site, not quite a home… To get a feel for it, have a look at the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic), or [images from 2013](/galleries/2013-domestic).
