*A free afternoon of incidental intervention and sited performance in Mcr City Centre, presented by Word of Warning on Saturday 9 July: turn up at any time from 12 noon to 5pm and discover activity around <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUP9hOfLluWs.kfWwdpVK74IU" target="_blank">St Ann's Square</a>…*            
                   
**Output Arts | *Running with Scissors***         
Output Arts presents the ultimate in hazardous track games: *Running with Scissors* gives you the opportunity to really test your metal. Fabulous prizes to be won!          

Output Arts produces playful and poignant site-specific installations: drawing with light under a flyover; searching for stories of loss on the beach with mumbling metal detectors; a motion-triggered ringing WWII telephone in a shopping centre.

**un-earthed collective | *Inflated Hazard — dicing with dystopia***         
*Roll the dice, inflate the hazard…*    
Every generation has its defining threat: a world at war; nuclear holocaust; climate change; terrorism. The corporate media inflates these threats with sensationalism. What effect does this inflation of fear have on us?         
This playful, provocative performance invites the audience to roll giant inflatable dice in the street, allowing chance to dictate what follows then offering a chance to tell a different story.         
*What happens next? You decide.*         
*Inflated Hazard* takes the form of a series of timed performances and an [ongoing installation](/current/2016-hazard/ongoing) with which you can interact.         
         
**Jin Bells | *Head In Hole 2016***         
A pointless body, a meaningless action, a nonsensical intervention into the city...      
             
Emerging Manchester artist Jin Bells works between theatre and performance art and has undertaken a residency at CRASH2016 and has upcoming performances at Islington Mill, Salford and Tempting Failure Festival, London.
