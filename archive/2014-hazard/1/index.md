####1pm departure          
**Stephen Donnelly | *DriftMob***           
A culture-jamming game of follow-the-leader: players take it in turns to lead a city-wide improvisation through the streets of Manchester, dishing out impromptu happenings and interventions as they go. The *DriftMob* begins in St Ann's Square; from there the details get hazy… all we know is it conspires to mark out it’s territory before evaporating back into the swarm of the street, leaving its traces in memories, rumours and urban myths.                
                            
A Swansea-based performer, creating site-specific and site-responsive work which encourages audiences to explore and experience their surroundings in new and unexpected ways. His most recent large scale project was *Block Party*, a pervasive theatrical experience which took place throughout locations across Cardiff Bay, commissioned as part of PlayARC Games Festival at the WMC. Since 2013 he has been under commission by Creative Bubble to create performances and events in Swansea City Centre.

####1-1.25pm        
**Bingo Meg + Disco Jazz | *Carboot Disco Bingo***        
An interactive experience — part dance-lesson, part party, part performance, part bingo. Essentially it's an elaborate game of bingo combined with the magic of disco, think Henry Ford meets Donna Summer down the gala! C'mon disco dogs, get your groove on!        
        
Megan Clark-Bagnall + Jasmine Loveys are Bristol-based independent artists, establishing *Carboot Disco Bingo* for Punchbowl Festival in 2012 — it has since toured the UK performing at festivals, art centres and Danny Boyle’s Shuffle Film Festival; in June 2013 they created and delivered several craft stations and *Carboot Disco Bingo* workshops for The Royal Shakespeare Company during their summer family festival. Jasmine makes solo performance, happenings, and interactive experiences; Megan likes making sculptural objects, installations, immersive art forms and live art.

####1.30-1.50pm        
**Antje Hildebrandt | *You Make Me Want To Lose You***        
An experimental investigation into the human relationship between body and its surroundings. The performance plays in the here and now, with moments of stillness and movement, intimacy and publicity. The dancers cannot see but must negotiate themselves together and alone in a strange environment. In this playful and risky act of exploration the performers subtly interact with their surroundings — evoking moments of surprise, empathy and wonder.        

Performers: Martha Passakopoulou + Rosalie Wahlfrid.
