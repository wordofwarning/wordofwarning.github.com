What can you make when your kitchen table is the stage + your camera is the audience?<br>An assembly of artists; a collage of commentary on where we find ourselves now…        
         
#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so **[July](/archive/2020-domestic/july)** began a series of "Domestic at homes" (<a href="http://youtu.be/IUNv7CARKLU" target="_blank">watch live stream</a>), continuing in **[August](/archive/2020-domestic/august)** (<a href="http://youtu.be/AOT29ZTtZAA" target="_blank">live stream</a>) and **[October](/archive/2020-domestic/october)** (<a href="http://youtu.be/seg57Z8-mfk" target="_blank">live stream</a>), with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.        
        
Real lives, real stories, real homes.         
        
[Domestic](/hab/domestic) 2020 series hosted by Peader Kirk + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
