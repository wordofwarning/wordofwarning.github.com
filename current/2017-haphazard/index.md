### Saturday 1 April 2017, 12noon-4pm. FREE             
Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org/events/haphazard-2017" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building with an April Fool's twist. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out.          
        
*Turn up at any time; come + go as you please + expect the unexpected…*

#### More        
To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; human dogs, cats, giant rats and the Gendersaurus Rex; hula-hooping and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet and a tiny bee-shaped world — why not join us to see what 2017 will conjure?
