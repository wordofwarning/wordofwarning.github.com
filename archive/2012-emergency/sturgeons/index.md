*She tries not to care when you say cruel things about her. No matter what, she'll always love you.*

A short, one-on-one performance based on a text by US author Daniel Abraham and adapted by his kind permission.

Sturgeon's Law is the name under which Aliki Chapple performs work that isn't quite theatre. Always text-based, this work has included installations, cabaret, durational pieces and pervasive games as well as interactive and one-on-one performances.
