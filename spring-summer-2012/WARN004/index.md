####In Brief
Two pairs of young women (and one hapless satyr) bring their own very irreverent twist to booze, benders and what we think of as dance…
A sneak-peak into what girls do on a lary night out…and a tangy story of gin and a lot of satsumas.

###The Mustdashios

####Who Are They?
The Mustdashios are Genevieve Say and Rachel Entwhistle:
Genevieve trained at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, and has since gone on to establish herself as a professional dancer working nationally and internationally. Genevieve combines her dance training with other influences, including clowning, theatre, film and live music,leading to an eclectic mix of collaborations including Collision (Lisi Perry), Gary Clarke, Flukt (Norway), Eee-Motion, Sweetshop Revolution, and Axial Dance. 

Born and bread in Accrington, Lancashire, Rachel grew up around pies, football, and bread and butter pudding. After deciding pie making wasn’t for her, Rachel instead went on to train in dance, working professionally as a performer around the UK and Scotland - with Lisi Perry (ex-Motionhouse/Scottish Dance theatre), Tids Pickard for EEE-Motion  and on the critics choice Scotland award-winning   Jane Eyre at Perth Theatre. 

####What People Have Said About Them
*‘Consistently absurd, uncompromisingly foolish, and committed to exposing the unruly side of dance theatre.The Mustdashios are no normal dancing duo. They offer a delightfully fresh approach to dance, comedy, and what it is to be a woman on stage. They’re daring and fearless in their choreography, insightful in their image making, and unashamedly grotesque whenever they find the opportunity Focusing on the oddities of day to day life, The Mustdashios will simultaneously provoke your imagination, unweave your expectations and entertain the pants off you.’*

Chips delves into the friendship of two young women who live for booze and sequined pants. Through witty observations and discerning movement, Chips aims to expose the less attractive side of human nature whilst out on the tiles. Using Manchester city centre as their stimulus, the Mustdashios draw on their cheeky northern unabashedness to take you on a journey in which they dance, laugh and possibly cry their way through an intoxicated friendship. 


##Gin & Satsumas
###Levantes Dance Theatre

####Who are They?
Winners of the Oxford Samuel Beckett Trust Award in 2010, Levantes Dance Theatre is Bethanie Harrison and Eleni Edipidi.  

Originally from Greece, Eleni trained at Laban and MMU and has performed internationally with the Belgian based company Victoria and has performed in the Opening Ceremonies of the Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympics Games!  Eleni is the recipient of The Marion North Mentoring Scheme 2009 and has worked with Lindsey Butcher as her mentor.  

Bethanie trained in Dance and Visual Art at MMU and has co-directed and co-choreographed LDT since the beginning. Bethanie has collaborated with art practitioners Andre Gingras and Anna Macdonald and has lead workshops in schools in the Northwest with “Charged 2 dance”. Bethanie is the recipient of The Bonnie Bird New Uk Choreography Award 2010.

Levantes Dance Theatre has a constant enthusiasm for fusing artistic disciplines and indulging in vibrant aesthetics. Current, bold and honest, the work visually explores contradictions: the mundane and divine, the absurd and the familiar in a kitsch cocoon of colourful activity.

####What People Have Said About Them
*“Often challenging, their previous works have established Levantes Dance Theatre as one of the most innovative modern dance organisations in the country. A powerful critique of glorified normality, Gin & Satsumas is every bit as refreshing as the title suggests”*
Aaron Lavery, Manchester Metro

*“Without a doubt one of the most intelligent, entertaining and generous works I've ever seen. We need more artists like this”.* Silke Arnold, Creative Projects Manager East London Dance

*“They bring the stage space alive with their strong presence, and striking use of visual environments. This is certainly a company worth looking out for!"*
Sally O'Donnell, Leicester University, De Monfort

 The story of gin and a lot of satsumas.

Returning by popular demand (oh, ok, mine!) in a one-off special, Gin & Satsumas was one of Levantes Dance Theatre’s first performance work which toured the North as part of In Transit in 2008 – but never showed in full in Manchester!

* “… a surreal cocktail of sensation. Seeming like a circus, with its disappearing floor lights, trapeze wired objects and obligatory cartoon clowns, we are drawn into this incongruous spectacle by Levantes Dance Theatre. Visually stunning, this carnival cascade of cross-dressing strange-faced people doing strange-placed things is curious yet oddly pleasing.”*  Mandy Richards @ Resolution! 2008
