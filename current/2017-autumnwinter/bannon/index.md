#### More         
>*I was born on the day the Pope came to Coventry, my home town. In my family this unexpected appearance was perceived as a blessing. A sublime gift.*        
        
Influenced by her experience as a person with albinism, Jo Bannon uses blinding light, proximity, movement and sound to create an extraordinary visual poem.         
        
*Alba* explores the stories we tell of ourselves and the stories told about us, the myths we inherit and the ones we embody, the identities we cannot shake off and so instead perform.           
         
#### Who is she          
A Bristol-based artist making live art and performance, Jo also works as a dramaturg and producer, and is an In Between Time associate artist and founder member of Residence. She has presented work in the UK and Europe — Word of Warning presented her intimate [*Exposure*](/archive/2013-domestic/bannon) during 2013's Domestic.            
        
Her work is concerned with human exchange and encounter, and explores how our physical bodies experience the world around us and how this sensory experience can or cannot be conveyed. She attempts to unpick the ways we look, hear and sense our immediate environment in order to rethink or  make unfamiliar these intrinsic human behaviors. Her performances often manifest as intimate encounters designed for single or small audiences (e.g. *Exposure*), alongside staged theatre work and installations.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
