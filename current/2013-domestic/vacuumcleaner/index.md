####More       
After ten years of being an outlaw and inpatient, notorious artist-activist the vacuum cleaner (famed for hijacking the Starbucks logo, parodying the Olympic twitter account and causing a minor riot by giving away 100,000 one cent Euros of free money) presents an autobiographical performance told through his psychiatric records, police intelligence files and corporate injunctions — all collected through the Data Protection Act.            
               
*Mental* is James' first autobiographical show, contrasting official language(s) against poignant and darkly humorous personal recollections. Spanning 13 years of his adult life, the show describes his experiences of severe and debilitating mental illness, suicide, social isolation, stigma, and police and corporate surveillance because of his activism and art.              
               
*"Although the show is intense, many of the taboos within the show need to be talked about. For example, the high rates of suicide in men under 35, current undercover police operations and the length that big business will go to silence its critics."*             
            
Held in the intimate setting of a bedroom, a limited audience are invited to join him under an oversized duvet. Accompanied by an OHP and vinyl records, James provides a welcoming environment for you to explore his pertinent experiences of the dynamics of power.            
             
####Who is he?            
the vacuum cleaner is an art and activism collective of one. Through site-specific performance, street-based intervention and film, the vacuum cleaner empowers his audience to address socio-political issues including consumerism and mental health discrimination. From one-man shows to large-scale participatory actions, his approach is variously subtle and extreme, but always candid, provocative and playful.                  
                   
He is an Artsadmin Associate Artist. His work has been commissioned and exhibited internationally, including at Tate Modern, ICA, Fierce Festival, the Centre for Contemporary Art Glasgow, the Liverpool Biennial, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), Wooster Collective (USA), Anti Festival (Finland), Centre d'Art Contemporain (Switzerland), Hebbel-Am-Ufer, Tanztendenz (Germany), Khoj Live 08 (India). His films have been commissioned by BBC4, Channel 4 and Arte.
