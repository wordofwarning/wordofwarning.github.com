#### Artists + Activity (*subject to change*)         
**Aidan Strudwick | *Human Mini-Golf***           
Like mini-golf but fun for a change.           
           
**Alex Bradley + Bill Leslie | *COME AS YOU ARE (guerrilla mix 1.0)***          
Surtitling the public's personal sense of expression — a playful set of 'in the moment' incidents.          
         
**Ali Wilson + Jessica Gibson | *Pair of Pears***          
We are a pair of Pears and we are looking for each other. 3—2—1—GO!          
         
**Charlotte CHW | *Caution: Falling…*** (no longer appears)         
Falling isn't a work of art but nor is it a crime. People are doing it in public every day. We just choose not to see it.             
           
**Dominique Baron-Bonarjee | *Collapse Manchester***             
A "slow-mob" exploring the pace of the city through the speed of the body.           
**Call for participants**: we're <a href="http://facebook.com/events/598733406960259" target="_blank">looking for brightly coloured slow-mobbers</a>.             
            
**Elena Koukoli + Andreas Papapetrou | *Out of Thin Air***           
An unexpected performance exploring emptiness and excess — imaginative, meditative, provoking and joyful.             

**Full Circle Arts + Playfuel | *Box Society***        
A game about our society, the pressure to fit in and the hurdles we face navigating our daily lives with different means and abilities.          
           
**Instant Dissidence | *Dancing With Strangers: From Calais to England***          
A choreographic act of border transgression: dance with a resident from 'The Jungle' refugee camp in Calais, in a virtual dance making connection across borders.          
         
**Jin Bells | *Head In Hole 2016***         
A pointless body, a meaningless action, a nonsensical intervention into the city...         

**Nathaniel Mason | *Occupied***          
Dying, desperate, gagging, bursting. This archive of public convenience is made by the people for the people.           
            
**Output Arts | *Running with Scissors***         
The ultimate in hazardous track games.        
         
**Sexcentenary | *WE REFUSE TO BE UNSEEN***         
Using humour and a sense of the absurd, a collective of women who identify as older, set about disrupting the flow of public spaces.         
          
**There There | *Text HOME***          
A durational invasion of immigration advice.          
          
**un-earthed collective | *Inflated Hazard — dicing with dystopia***         
Roll the giant inflatable dice — dice with dystopia and explore the hazards of our times.         
         
**Vivian Chinasa Ezugha | *Because of hair; the dichotomy of culture and identity***         
I am not historical, I am not futuristic, I am not the old nor am I the new. I am but an object made from human hair. My purpose is to disturb, to interrupt your contemplation and seduce your vision; so that I become an image of your imagination.
