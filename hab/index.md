####Stimulating…extraordinary…performance…     

Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer and advocate of contemporary performance, live art and sited work in the north west. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy, working in collaboration with a range of colleagues and venues to produce showing opportunities, platforms and artist development projects.    

Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with artists, colleagues and venues to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish.    

Since Jan 2012, however hÅb has gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning]((http://www.wordofwarning.org), a peripatetic programme of and [regular bulletin](http://wordofwarning.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0d0b9e09079cc9204f77cb396&id=d72a36f1c2) for contemporary live work in Manchester and beyond.    

From **emergency**, an annual micro-festival for new work, now in its 14th year, which presents up to 40 short pieces in a day each September/October and its Merseyside sibling, **‘poolside emergency**; through **Works Ahead**, a series of small commissions for new work, we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging work and artists in contemporary performance and live art.  We also co-produce the **Turn** micro-festival for north west dance and dance makers and the ensuing **Turn Prize**.    

hÅb also works as a curator of sited performance and intervention presenting, **Hazard**, a biennial micro-festival of intervention, taking performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre.     

In any given year, hÅb might work with 200 artists, present 3 platforms, 1 sited festival and show over 100 pieces of work.    

hÅb is supported by public funding through Arts Council England and is funded by Manchester City Council.
