It is a dance of possibilities that you, the audience, engage in with performers. A fun and immersive work that shows the full poetential of performers working with technology.

###The journey between spaces:    

####Larkin’ About    *Mix Tape* by [**Vee Uye**](http://www.twitter.com/vee_uye)     
A retro-audio treasure hunt with a soundtrack that takes you between spaces and into the puzzle of our hearts. Players navigate the space with analogue personal stereos and augment the narrative with their own memories.     
*Mixtape* n: a compilation of favourite pieces of music, typically by many different artists, recorded on to tape or another medium by an individual.    

####Sam Treadaway    *Bound and Re-bound - a 'post' performance*    
The artist will roll a ball-like form, made from collected postal elastic bands and keys collected from the street between Castlefield Gallery and BLANKSPACE, periodically throughout the day in a circular route, adding any postal elastic bands or keys found en-route.    

Sam Treadaway is a multimedia artist whose practise includes live art, book-arts, sculpture and installation, some of which incorporates the application of scent. Often with reference to the urban built environment and making use of existing frictions between aesthetic form and utilitarian function, the artist engages with an editing and re-aligning of found objects, structures and systems, though which new meaning is made possible. The interplay between the arts, as with other fields of research, frequently informs this process.

A performance about a desire for stillness.  It is about what moves to immobilise and what is in stillness to move, about an impossible possibility that can just exist in interrelations.
