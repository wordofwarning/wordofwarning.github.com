**NEW TAG LINE REQ'D HERE…**          
New copy here too = make up our annual sampler of what's next in contemporary performance and live art — pushing the boundaries of form and content. [Autumn 2016](/archive/2016-autumnwinter) saw Word of Warning show over 40?? emerging performances in spaces ranging from a building site to a theatre… From this enormous variety of work we have invited four artists at different stages in their careers to further develop their shows for Works Ahead 2017. They're all at the very beginning of their explorations…

Post-popular prodigy Lucy McCormick and her Girl Squad present a trashstep-dubpunk morality play for the modern age. Casting herself in all the main roles, Lucy will attempt to re-connect to her own moral conscience by re-enacting old biblical stories via a nu-wave holy trinity of dance, power ballads and performance art. With trademark absurdism and enthusiasm, Lucy puts her best foot forward in the face of existential deadlock.
