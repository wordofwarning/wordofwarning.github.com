*Presented by* Word of Warning, Contact + STUN         
         
### Thursday 17 + Friday 18 May 2018, 7.30pm        
Our annual sampler of new performance is a double bill of new works in development from Emma Geraghty + Vijay Patel.             
            
#### Emma Geraghty       
A girl, a guitar, and a message of hope… *Fat Girl Singing* is an anthem of self-acceptance and a call to arms for those who simply don't fit the model.         
        
#### Vijay Patel      
At that point in a conversation when it all gets too much, are we more worried about the thought of leaving than the action itself? *Sometimes I Leave* unravels the inner workings of the Asperger's mind, before making a dash for the door…      
      
To get a feel for it, have a look at [Works Ahead 2017's programme](/archive/2017-worksahead).        
        
Works Ahead is also seed-commissioning Jamal Gerald's *Complexion* — exploring the historic experiences of the house and the field slaves; and drawing a parallel with contemporary pop culture and attitudes to race. Being developed in partnership with Transform in Leeds, look out for a low key interaction.

#### What people have said about Works Ahead        
>*A cathartic, funny and brutally honest show about bodies, particles and the universe.*<br><a href="http://afronalysis.com/2017/05/14/review-superposition-stun" target="_blank">Afronalysis (2017 review)</a>           
>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless …make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*<br><a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave (2016 review)</a>           
>• *Brilliant platform for emerging talent.<br>• Great to see new work by younger artists.<br>• Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.<br>• I enjoyed both shows even though they were very different. I look forward to seeing how they develop.*<br>[Audience feedback from 2017](/archive/2017-worksahead)/[16](/archive/2016-worksahead)/[15](/archive/2015-worksahead)
