###Saturday 12 July 2014, daytime. Free     
Manchester's stripiest festival returns to unleash a fifth wave of bizarre behaviour on the city centre… random actions, strange antics, ludic activities + surprising sprees of eccentricity.    
              
To get a feel for Hazard see 2012's [programme](/archive/2012-hazard) + [image gallery](/galleries/2012-hazard).
