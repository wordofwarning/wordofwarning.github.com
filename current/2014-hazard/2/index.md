####2-2.25pm        
**Bingo Meg + Disco Jazz | *Carboot Disco Bingo***        
An interactive experience — part dance-lesson, part party, part performance, part bingo. Essentially it's an elaborate game of bingo combined with the magic of disco, think Henry Ford meets Donna Summer down the gala! C'mon disco dogs, get your groove on!        
        
Megan Clark-Bagnall + Jasmine Loveys are Bristol-based independent artists, establishing *Carboot Disco Bingo* for Punchbowl Festival in 2012 — it has since toured the UK performing at festivals, art centres and Danny Boyle’s Shuffle Film Festival; in June 2013 they created and delivered several craft stations and *Carboot Disco Bingo* workshops for The Royal Shakespeare Company during their summer family festival. Jasmine makes solo performance, happenings, and interactive experiences; Megan likes making sculptural objects, installations, immersive art forms and live art.

####2-3pm            
**Nicola Canavan | *MILK***            
A durational piece of work exploring the role of Mother, Canavan invites you to engage in an act of tenderness with an underlying inquiry. She is offering you milk, like never before.             
            
Born in North East England, Nicola Canavan performs and shows work nationally and internationally within programmes such as Momentum Festival (Brussels), performance space (London), In Between Time (Bristol), City of Women (Ljubljana), SPILL National Platform (Ipswich) and Emergency Accomodation (Manchester). Her practice is rooted in action-based performance and spans live work, documentations of its products + traces, and the re-presentation of these in other forms. Questioning notions of beauty, pain and expectation through a poetry which transforms brutal acts into tender and generous anecdotes of allegiance; thriving on the richness and allure of visual language; using performance and interactions to reflect on experience; using living marks from her skin to draw longer, deeper and more profound images haunted by a body once known. 

             
              
            
####2-3.30pm               
**The Association Of Low Visibility Workers | *By Association***             
A discreet game to be played between you and the Association, via your smart phone. Take care that only your most trusted friends know that you are playing. You'll need a charged smart phone with credit/facility to send a number of text messages. Everything else will reveal itself to you.

####2.30-2.50pm        
**Antje Hildebrandt | *You Make Me Want To Lose You***        
An experimental investigation into the human relationship between body and its surroundings. The performance plays in the here and now, with moments of stillness and movement, intimacy and publicity. The dancers cannot see but must negotiate themselves together and alone in a strange environment. In this playful and risky act of exploration the performers subtly interact with their surroundings — evoking moments of surprise, empathy and wonder.        
        
Antje Hildebrandt is a London-based choreographer and performer who creates site-specific performances, installations, one-to-one encounters, video and theatrical works. Her first choreography *Hybrid* was chosen to represent England in Bari, Italy at the 2008 Biennale for Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean.
