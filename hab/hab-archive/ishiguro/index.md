# ABOUT THE SHOW - LAYOUT

---

An intimate and playful experience in the darkness 'taken' by you. A photo documentation piece which only exists at the flashes of moments, occurring between you and the performer. Inspired by Vito Acconci's *Blinks* (1969).    

Yoko Ishiguro is a performance maker, performer and actress. Mostly, her works are site/time/situation-specific and performed in a toilet, a rice field etc. with some daily technologies to look at time, distance and communication.
