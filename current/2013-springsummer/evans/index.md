*Presented by* Word of Warning + The Lowry

#### In Brief
*A live scrap book. An unfinished love affair. A made up true story.*    

Lowri is in trouble. She leads a double life. By day she ponders the passing of time, sifting through the fractured memories of people left with snippets of who they were. By night she makes art in strange places: fleeting, filmic moments with unsuspecting mortals. All to draw meaning from our jumble-sale lives.    
  
But the telescope has turned on this meddling voyeur. You are invited to witness her attempt to piece together a sparkling constellation from stuff, love and darkness; to understand what we are, how we fit together and what we leave behind.

This is Lowri's first feature length solo show and will see her visual art and theatre practice blur together on the night of her thirtieth birthday.

*"I am interested in human experience, the mundane and the miraculous. I try to strip information away to the barest truth, to the startling and underwhelming inside of things, often starting with the autobiographical. I am fascinated by the blurring of art and real life, and play as much as I can with that, subsequently my life appears in my work and I also take my work out to non-art spaces and connect with people from all walks of life."*
