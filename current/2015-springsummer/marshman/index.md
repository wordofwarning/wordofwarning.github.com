####In Brief
Hazy nostalgia has brought Tom to think about Bambi and the twists and turns in his own life. Stumbling along a forest path, he leads audiences in an intimate skip through the trees; where seasons bring new adventures and glimpses of the past make you fuzzy inside.       
        
See a short [video](http://vimeo.com/35815281) introducing Tom and his practice.

####More         
Last seen [as a marvellous pair of legs during our opening season](/archive/2012-springsummer/marshman), we now find Tom Marshman thinking about Bambi — this iconic Disney film, responsible for twists and turns in his life, is also a curious filter through which to look back… Premiered at Latitude Festival 2013, Tom has worked with Christopher Green, Dickie Beau, Brenda Waite, Laura Dannequin, Steve Nice, Karen Christopher and costume designer David Curtis-Ring to create *We Need To Talk About Bambi*.        
        
####Who is he       
A performance artist, Tom Marshman actively encourages a dialogue with audiences and participants — aiming to create a 
safe space to share their thoughts and experiences; the results give very evocative authentic glimpses into everyday things. To date the purpose of Tom's work has been to address issues that are often considered as mundane or commonplace; his work celebrates everyday domestic objects, exploring what is often taken for granted.       
         
Making performance for over ten years, he has created over twenty projects in a wide range of mediums including performance, photography, installation, publication + film; and showing work at venues/festivals including Arnolfini (Bristol), Basement Brighton, Battersea Arts Centre, Bristol Old Vic, Chapter Arts Centre (Cardiff), Colchester Arts Centre, Exeter Phoenix, In Between Time (Bristol), National Review of Live Art (Glasgow), Oval House (London) + White Nights.          
          
####What people have said about Tom         
>*One of the most exciting things about Marshman's work is his ability to pick a seemingly small subject and peel back the layers to expose something unexpectedly profound…*<br>Big Issue
