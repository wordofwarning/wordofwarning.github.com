###Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer and strategic advocate of contemporary performance, live art and sited work in the North. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy, working in collaboration with a range of venues to produce showing opportunities, platforms and artist development projects like Emergency, Turn, Hazard + Works Ahead.    
      
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with artists, colleagues and venues to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish.
        
Since Jan 2012, however hÅb gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/index) — a peripatetic programme of, and regular bulletin for, contemporary live work in Manchester and beyond.   
        
This site aims to offer information to artists wanting to know more about our work and how to get involved. For more information about our public programme go to [Word of Warning](/index).   
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), an annual micro-festival for new live work (now in its 14th year) which presents up to 40 short pieces in a day each September/October and its Merseyside sibling, [‘Poolside Emergency](/hab/poolside); through [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work, we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance and live art. We also co-produce the [Turn](/hab/turn) micro-festival for new NW dance + dance-makers and the ensuing Turn Prize.    
        
hÅb also works as a curator of sited performance and intervention presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention, taking performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre (next in July 2014).    
        
In any given year, hÅb might work with 200 artists, present 3 platforms, 1 sited festival and show over 100 pieces of work.    
         
hÅb is supported using public funding through Arts Council England and is funded by Manchester City Council.
