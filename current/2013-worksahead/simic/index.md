####In Brief:
A homage to Kurt Cobain, lost youth, impossible and failed encounters from a life lived retrospectively.    

####More:    
This solo performance is a story about 1994.    

A series of memory excerpts. An exploration of lost youth and ageing. The rise and fall of Nirvana.    

A mix of historical, political and popular references. The Balkan War and its atrocities. Grunge and the suicide of Kurt Cobain. Inertia. Seduction. A number of the boys I kissed. My failed move to Seattle.    

This piece is about the troubling thrill of living life retrospectively.    

*I found myself thinking about Kurt Cobain during Live Art therapy workshop with Oriana Fox in Grizedale Forest in the Lake District. 'There she is with her hands, her arms in the air with the objects above her, her hair almost like Kurt Cobain’s, all that blond and kind of scruffy.*    

####Who is she?    
Lena Simic, performance practitioner and pedagogue, born in Dubrovnik, Croatia, living in Liverpool, UK. Co-organizer of The Institute for the Art and Practice of Dissent at Home, an art activist initiative run from her family home. Lena's autobiographical performance practice is informed by its relation to everyday lived experience, memory and fantasy.    

In 1994 I was 19. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he died. I kissed 12 boys in 1994.
