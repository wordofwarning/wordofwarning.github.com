**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!        
        
Our **[fourth Haphazard](/current/2017-haphazard)** took place on **April Fool's afternoon 2017**, Saturday 1 April 12noon-4pm at Z-arts — with a baker's dozen of free activity — *sing-a-long with a fish, walk like Sponge Bob, dance with a bear or play a trick on your friends…*        
         
To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; human dogs, cats, giant rats and the Gendersaurus Rex; hula-hooping and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet and a tiny bee-shaped world… to get a feel for it have a look at [2016](/galleries/2016-haphazard)/[2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard)/[2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard)'s image galleries and to get an idea of what's gone before see [2016](/archive/2016-haphazard)/[2015](/archive/2015-haphazard)/[2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard)'s archives.
