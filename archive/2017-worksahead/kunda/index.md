#### More              
"*The sun is a flaming cocktail of hydrogen<br>Literally too hot to handle<br>Hot enough to melt a landing probe<br>I have the same fire in me*"         
          
*Superposition* takes you down the rabbit hole of physics, from the quantum world of the tiny to the expanses of the universe — via a lap dancing club — seeking to answer the big questions in life:          
           
What are the real laws of attraction?<br>How do we satisfy our longing to connect?<br>What is my place in the universe?<br>What makes me, me?                
           
A playful journey of discovery: about science; about sensuality; about spirituality; about ourselves; and how our bodies magically mirror the universe through a constellation of particles twinkling within us.

#### What people have said about her               
>*It was surprising and broke many of the clichés about live art — particularly live art dealing with issues of gender and race. I thought you had great presence.*<br>John McGrath, Manchester International Festival, on *Superposition*              
             
>★★★★ *…highly imaginative …so lively and moving that there can be no barriers to audiences having a very good time indeed.*<br><a href="http://www.whatsonstage.com/manchester-theatre/reviews/amsterdam-contact-manchester_35979.html" target="_blank">What's On Stage, on *Amsterdam*</a>        
>*…richly textured, poignant, funny, gloriously descriptive, cleverly constructed…*<br><a href="http://www.writeoutloud.net/public/blogentry.php?blogentryid=44624" target="_blank">Judy Gordon, Write Out Loud, on *Amsterdam*</a>
