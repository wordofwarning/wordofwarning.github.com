**Turn** is our annual platform for NW dancers + dance-makers, featuring up to 15 short pieces of work over two nights in Manchester — see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-turn) and [gallery](/galleries/2013-turn); the sixth Turn takes place on 4/5 April 2014, at [Contact](http://contactmcr.com).         
           
##Turn 2014 — call for proposals        
**Friday 4 + Saturday 5 April 2014 — Contact, Manchester**        
Turn 2014 is a hÅb, Contact, Dance Manchester, Live at LICA co-production and a greenroom legacy project. [www.turnmcr.org](http://www.turnmcr.org) | #TurnMcr        
        
**North West** dancers + dance-makers (*aged 18+*) are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works in progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event.        
        
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 17 January 2014**        
         
>An open submission dance platform for North West dancers + dance-makers:        
>● short finished pieces;       
>● excerpts;        
>● works in progress;        
>● sited works in + around the building also welcomed.         
>Proposals should be for pieces with some live presence, 20 minutes maximum for show-type work, technically simple, adaptable to quick turnarounds and suitable for showing alongside other pieces.        
>Sited and intervention-based works in + around the venue (Contact) are also strongly encouraged.        
>We are also accepting proposals for video based work to be screened around the building.        
         
###Turn:        
● a public platform;        
● an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work;        
● an artist networking event;         
● a selection platform for the Turn Prize (*a small, supported commission, supported by Dance Manchester, Contact, hÅb, Live at LICA*).        
        
We are looking for dance in any form which uses the artists' creativity, has strong concept, original choreography and professional aspiration. For example, alongside Contemporary, we'd be interested in hearing about street dancers who are looking to choreograph a piece rather than to present a demonstration of skill; or classical work (from Ballet to Kathak, African and Chinese dance to Bharata Natyam) that is being re-imagined or re-explored, rather than a straight re-presentation of classic choreography.        
        
Priorities are for high quality and exciting dance based work by **North West** artists, which has not been seen in Manchester before.        
        
###To apply:        
>1 Read the venue (Contact)'s [tech specs](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/contact-tech-specs) + [policies and procedures](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/policies-and-procedures-14138).        
>2 Complete and submit the [proposal](http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/turn-2014-proposal-form) + [monitoring](http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form) forms.        
>3 Include a short (compulsory) video submission — upload to your own YouTube/Vimeo or similar page and include the link in your proposal form; alternatively send via [www.wetransfer.com](http://www.wetransfer.com) (or similar) to <mailto:turn@habarts.org> OR send a DVD to: hÅb, c/o Z-arts, 335 Stretford Road, Manchester, M15 5ZA        
>*Video should be short (max 10 mins) and does not have to be high quality. It can be from a camcorder, digital camera or mobile phone. Rehearsal footage, a video sketch of ideas or a video proposal with clips of previous work are all good ways of showing us your style and what you are proposing.*        
        
We would appreciate it if everyone could use the online form, but if you have significant difficulties contact <mailto:turn@habarts.org> for a .doc version.        
         
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 17 January 2014**
