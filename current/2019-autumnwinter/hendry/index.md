As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
