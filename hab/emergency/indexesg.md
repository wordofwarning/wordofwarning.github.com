**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, since 2000 showing around 30 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester each autumn. A new iteration for 2020 is **Emergency StopGap** — a small informal platform to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter…            
<hr>         
Our inaugural **Emergency StopGap** takes place on **Thursday 27 February 2020 (6-10pm)** in the decaying splendour of Manchester's <a href="https://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a> — with the call for artist proposals now open until **Friday 17 January 2020, 5pm** — see full details <a href="http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">here</a>.          

Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media, and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals for:<br>• durational, one to one, and limited capacity work;<br>• performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces.<br>To get a feel for it, have a look at 2019's [daytime programme at NIAMOS](/current/2019-emergency/daytime).<br>NB — StopGap is *not* looking for "black-box" show-type work.           
         
**Emergency StopGap is:**<br>• an informal Pay What You Decide public event and open submission platform;<br>• an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work.       
         
**Please note:**<br>• Emergency StopGap will feature around 10 pieces of work throughout the evening;<br>• work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable;<br>• Emergency StopGap will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses;<br>• access to power + technology is limited in this site — work that can use domestic or battery powered technology is strongly encouraged;<br>• we apologise but physical access to the building is challenging — please ask for specifics if you have physical access needs and are considering making a proposal;<br>• whilst we don't encourage it, you are permitted to submit more than one proposal but it is unlikely that more than one would be successful from a single artist/group.
