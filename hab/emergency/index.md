Somewhat of an institution in these parts, **Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance featuring up to 40 short pieces of work in a single day, across a number of Manchester venues.     
     
To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2013 [archive](/current/2013-emergency) and [gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).    

Our [fourteenth Emergency](/current/2013-emergency) took place on **Saturday 5 October 2013**, at BLANKSPACE + Z-arts.    

Emergency is:    
>a free, public micro-festival + platform;   
>an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
>a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by hÅb.
