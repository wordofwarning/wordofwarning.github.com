####In Brief                      
Can you ever fully recover from years of childhood abuse & trauma?    
*My Brother's Father* is an installation with live performance. This intimate and visceral work invites you to witness silenced and hidden fragments of childhood memories which piece together an abusive relationship and the preservation  of self, sanity and survival.    

Sited in an empty flat, the audience are given tools to reveal and discover the work, and also to walk away when they choose.
