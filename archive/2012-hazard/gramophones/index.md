In April 2012, three women made a journey from one end of Great Britain to the other. Trusting only their resourcefulness and the kindness of strangers they made an 18 day, 874 mile journey from Land’s End to John O’Groats. 

*This is a story about why we leave places, why we stay and what we imagine of places we have never been to.*    

The Gramophones will create a map of the UK from objects found on their journey.    

The Gramophones are an all female theatre company based in Nottingham. They devise witty, interactive theatre with a twinkle in its eye. They place the audience at the centre of their performances and regard them not only as voyeurs but as players in their work.
