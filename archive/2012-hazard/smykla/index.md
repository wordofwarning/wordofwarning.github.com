A much-needed contemporary makeover for our paper currency, 'still graced by features of figures from the past'. From his *FACE VALUE Currency X Change* desk, Harald Smykla will invite members of the public to sit for some extraordinary portrait drawings that will 're-face' real banknotes with the features of real Mancunians.

For one afternoon, British money can claim to represent the diversity of British society in the 21st century.

Harald Smykla is a German artist based in London. His time and context specific practice merges notions of performance and drawing, often involving people and places in the public realm. He has performed and exhibited across England and Europe, including Manchester's Cornerhouse. He is represented by [England & Co](http://www.englandgallery.com), London.
