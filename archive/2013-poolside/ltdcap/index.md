**Kitty Graham | The Bare Earth**        
*You stand before a bed of earth. Perhaps it is empty, still, peaceful — perhaps it is not.*        
Using a bed of earth — the place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other — *The Bare Earth* explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.

**PGB | FTSE**    
*I have a secret. Do you?*    
 We all have secrets... Some we will share and others we won't. What is your secret worth?    
 Come and find out... I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.    
  
        
**Rachel Gomme | Handover**    
*If I give you my hand, will you give me yours?*        
An invitation to a brief exchange of touch that leaves a lasting trace.

**Rebekka Platt | The Body (extract/work-in-progress)**    
An intimate live & digital performance inspired by film noir, mystery & silent discos. Observe and engage with a body left on the fringe of the world.

**Xristina Penna and the aswespeakproject | Uncovered:	can clothes tell stories?**  
*Uncovered* uses multi-media, direct audience participation, sound and a sewing machine to *uncover* stories related to our clothes and build up a patchwork of memories, words and responses.
