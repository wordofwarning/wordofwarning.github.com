####In Brief
![Maelstrom](w7maesltrom.jpg)
Bursting into life for its fourth outing, *Turn* pivots into a new home to showcase new and experimental work from the region’s dancemakers.  In a frenzy of loose limbs and lyrical gestures, unfeasible stretches and frantic rhythms, twelve shows and countless performers fill the building with every style imaginable. 

####Who Are They?

In its brief lifespan, *Turn* has seen a real surge in homegrown talent and vision –  mesmerising immersive landscapes, breathtaking physical extremes and extraordinary playful antics in the bar and street.  A true lucky-dip glimpse into just what the North West has to offer – check back here for the results of the open-call and to see just what this year’s turn-out will be.
