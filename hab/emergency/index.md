**Emergency, hÅb's annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, is now calling for proposals.**            
           
Our **twentieth Emergency** takes place on **Saturday 21 September 2019** at two sites in Manchester's Hulme: <a href="https://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a> during the afternoon, and <a href="http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> (incl. <a href="http://stunlive.com" target="_blank">STUN Studio</a>) during the evening, with the call for proposals open until **Friday 9 August, 5pm** — see full details <a href="http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">here</a>.             
         
With a whole range of spaces to fill — what we now need is a lots of great work! Artists working in live art and contemporary performance are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress, or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event.       
For daytime work at NIAMOS we are looking for durational, performance installation, intervention and limited capacity and 1-2-1 work.           
For evening work at Z-arts/STUN we are looking for short (20 min max) show-type work.       
               
To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2018 [programme](/archive/2018-emergency) + [gallery of images](/galleries/2018-emergency).           
         
**Emergency is:**    
• a pay-what-you-decide, public micro-festival + open submission platform;        
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).      
          
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be: 20 minutes maximum in duration; low-tech or no-tech, and suitable for quick turnarounds; self-supporting in terms of props, set, equipment, and specialised technology.         
            
As this seems to be a recurrent question: whilst we don't encourage it, you are permitted to submit more than one proposal but it is unlikely that more than one would be successful from a single artist/group.           
            
**Please note:**          
• Emergency typically features at least 20 short pieces of work throughout the day/evening;        
• our technology resources are limited, please bear this in mind when making a proposal;         
• Emergency 2019 will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses.        
• There may be more resources available for a larger durational piece for the NIAMOS auditorium/stage area. Please get in touch to discuss.
