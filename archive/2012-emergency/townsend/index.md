*Go onto Google Maps and find a place where you feel like you lost something. Pinpoint the location and explain what you lost.*        

With a laptop, a printer and Google maps, you and Jojo Townsend navigate the world of lost items and people. You'll leave something behind of yourself but you'll take more with you: a fuller heart and a few biscuits in your belly.	    

Jojo Townsend is a performance artist and designer currently in her final year at Central St Martins. She makes heartfelt art pieces, installations and one-to-one performances. They are about people she has met, loved, lived with and lost.
