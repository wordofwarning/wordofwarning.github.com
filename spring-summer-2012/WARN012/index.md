####In Brief
*Cheeky, thought-provoking and sometimes raunchy sprees of eccentricity.*

Manchesterâ€™s micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance returns for its fourth outing - chance encounters, random occurrences and risky ventures around and about the city centre.

The full programme will be announced very shortly at [hazardmcr.org](http://hazardmcr.org)
