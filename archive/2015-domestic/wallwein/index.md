####More    
*There I was, tipped to be one to watch after doing a show on the wings of an aeroplane a year earlier. 1999, my life was moving in the right direction – a career, a new home and a new girlfriend.*    
Louise grew up in care from the age of nine and *Glue* shows both her fierce independence and emotional vulnerability alongside each other. In one scene she reads from her actual social service file. The monologue is truth, no artifice. Born, transferred, placed, discharged, returned… There is plenty of humour and beautiful imagery.       
        
This is rare story of a prodigal daughter returning to her family and the slow realisation that she will never be part of it. She must build her own.     
       
Part of the story takes place in Salford and Louise is looking forward to taking it back to the community there.      
       
Originally a short monologue commissioned by Liz O’Neill of Z-Arts for *Family Matters* and The Royal Exchange to explore the modern family and to see how these contemporary models can be better served in theatre. *Glue* has already moved and inspired many people in a short form.
