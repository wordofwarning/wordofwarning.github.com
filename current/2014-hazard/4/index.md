**Kris Canavan | *The Leveller***          
As a political movement, the term "Leveller" first referred to a faction of New Model Army Agitators and their London supporters in 1649 who were allegedly plotting to assassinate the king; it had been used in 17th-century England as a term of abuse for rural rebels and in the Midland Revolt of 1607 to refer to those who "levelled" hedges in enclosure riots. Organised at a national level, with offices in a number of London inns and taverns such as The Rosemary Branch in Islington, *Levellers* would identify one another by sprigs of rosemary that they would wear in their hats…

####4.15-4.35pm        
**Antje Hildebrandt | *You Make Me Want To Lose You***        
An experimental investigation into the human relationship between body and its surroundings. The performance plays in the here and now, with moments of stillness and movement, intimacy and publicity. The dancers cannot see but must negotiate themselves together and alone in a strange environment. In this playful and risky act of exploration the performers subtly interact with their surroundings — evoking moments of surprise, empathy and wonder.
