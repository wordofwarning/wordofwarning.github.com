**Adam Lowe** | ***Encounters with Ecstasies***        
Presenting selections from his solo show *Ecstasies*, Adam Lowe as Beyonce Holes will lead you through a descent into the glittery history of Manchester's gay clubs. From intimate moments in a toilet cubicle to revelry on the dancefloor, club kid Beyonce reaches for the strobe-light stars across the ceiling and whispers profane incantations to the Lord of the Dance.        
        
Directed by Gerry Potter, music by Nikki Franklin, animation by Charlie Taylor.
