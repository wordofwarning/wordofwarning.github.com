#### More         
*I want you to know what's happening…*        
        
From what might be a news desk, an office, a bedroom, a bunker under a mountain or a theatre, two people — reporters, senators, freedom fighters, or just… well… concerned citizens like you — think about what it is to speak up, speak out, blow the whistle and lift the veil.        
        
*AMtSB* charts a course from the Top Secret secrets of WWI intelligence (via the moon, 1972's Chess World Championships, a disco in Oklahoma and the cafeteria at CERN) through to 9/11, the erosion of privacy, Edward Snowden and the terror of a future that might already be upon us.        
       
Combining original text and classified intelligence documents with film, music and sound, Proto-type vent their frustration at the insidious machine of surveillance. How did we get to the point where our governments are spying on us, and how is that changing who we are?
         
#### Who are they?        
A company of multi-disciplinary artists led by Rachel Baynton, Gillian Lees + Andrew Westerside, Proto-type create original performance work that is diverse in scale, subject and medium. Alongside touring *AMtSB*, this has recently included a two-week long theatrical experience using pervasive technologies (*Fortnight*), a multimedia concert-performance featuring animation and live laptop orchestra (*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* — at Word of Warning in [Spring 2014](/archive/2014-spring/prototype)), and a radio drama with the BBC.         
          
Since 1997 they've made work and supported young artists in Armenia, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, the US + Zimbabwe: founded in New York City by Peter S. Petralia (1997-2006), relocating to Lancaster's Storey Institute (2006-10), then Manchester's Northern Quarter (2010-14) and now Lincoln's Cathedral Quarter, they make and support work across the region.            
        
#### What people have said about *A Machine they're…*         
>*An inspired, deeply political essay rounded off by heartfelt empathy.*<br><a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720700401872412673" target="_blank">Alex Ballinger</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720680046999023616" target="_blank">Oxfordshire Guardian</a>          
>*…a bombastic, dynamic explanation of world affairs since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013.<br>I think that we're all broadly aware of the vast level of surveillance that the government subjects us to. The strength of AMtSB, however, is that their humour and simple, compelling performance presents the facts plainly and directly challenges any sense that this is something that we can simply ignore, or pretend does not apply to 'people like us'.*<br><a href="http://scan.lusu.co.uk/index.php/2016/02/09/review-proto-type-theatre-a-machine-theyre-secretly" target="_blank">Student Comment And News</a>, Lancaster University
