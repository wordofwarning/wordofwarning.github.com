**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into all ages live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org)' building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!
        
**In [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard)** we filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!) — **[2015](/archive/2015-haphazard)** saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!); to get a feel for it have a look at [2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard) + [2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard) images.       
        
Our **[third Haphazard](/archive/2016-haphazard)** took over Z-arts on Saturday 20 February 2016, with audiences coming and going as they pleased between 12noon and 4pm. Not just for children but live art for ALL ages, the day appealed to adults and children alike (even if the kids needed to explain it to the adults!). With thirteen works, the [programme](/archive/2016-haphazard/programme) used a variety of spaces — from black box to gallery to café — have a look at [images from the day](/galleries/2016-haphazard).         
        
[Haphazard 2016](/archive/2016-haphazard) was presented by Word of Warning + Z-arts; produced by hÅb + Z-arts; supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council; supported by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Breakthrough Fund.
