**Hazard - Saturday 12 July, Manchester City Centre - is calling for proposals** 
Presented by Word of Warning, produced by hÅb and The Larks in collaboration with the participating artists, a greenroom legacy project.    

**[Proposals are now invited for Hazard 2014](http://hazardmcr.posthaven.com/670552?draft=tjcYVJFzjEHjpb_jhWf8PHK7wKwXTlo2VoxIJCzdhBs=)**    

**Deadline 6pm Friday 16 May 2014:**    
 A micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance, blurring the boundaries between art and activism… cheeky, thought-provoking and sometimes raunchy sprees of eccentricity…    

 Manchester’s unique micro-festival of all things bizarre and stripy returns for its fifth outing, and invites you to join in with its strange antics and ludic(rous) activities.  

So far we’ve wrapped Cathedral Gardens in fluttering hazard tape, pitted together a lion and a unicorn, moved the goalposts (literally) and witnessed flat packed children take over streets of Manchester, oh, and conducted a hoolahoopathon.  The Larks had the public riddling, racing and chasing as urban archaeologists and private investigators: injecting mass gaming into [St Ann’s Square](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/St.+Ann's+Church/@53.481784,-2.245663,3a,75y,218.69h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1syYuOT36eMUL4WFAfihEJIg!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x487bb1c3df375453:0x799439d91859d49d!6m1!1e1) and beyond.       
 
 To date Hazard has produced four micro-festivals of sited performance and intervention - over 80 artists have taken to the streets of Manchester including: Action Hero, Alex Bradley, Juliann O’Malley, Richard DeDomenici, Katherina Radeva, Michael Pinchbeck, Jordan Mackenzie, Shahram Entekhabi and the vacuum cleaner.    

 For a glimpse of previous outbreaks of hazardous behaviour see [the 2012 programme](http://www.wordofwarning.org/archive/2012-hazard/index.html) + [image gallery](/galleries/2012-hazard).    

**In 2014 we are seeking to do it all again, once more incorporating playful interjections from The Larks.**    

*Think big, think bright, think irreverent!*
