####More            
A tale of hubris, planes, demos and undercover deceit told by an award-winning performer. Ten years ago an activist and close friend of Mark's was exposed as a spy for BAE Systems, infiltrating the movement. Now Mark wants to find him and has some questions to ask. This is a true story.          
              
*Cuckooed* picks up from where the award-winning *Bravo Figaro* left off in style, using interviews from friends, colleagues, activists and journalists to examine the impact of betrayal. It is a personal and timely tale that tries to unearth what it means to be spied upon by a corporation under the sanction of the state.            
              
Winner of an Edinburgh 2014 *Fringe First Award*, expect plenty of laughs, some weird characters, documentary styles, probably a tear or two, and the vague possibility that Mark might get beaten up in the process of making it as he tries to find out if he wants revenge — or if he can forgive a friend.
