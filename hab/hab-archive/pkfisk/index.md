*Increase personal flexibility, reduce social tension and gain moral strength by joining PK Fiskulturnik in the long march to socialist self- realisation through Yugo yoga.*

*Yugo yoga : the long march* is a durational performance piece inspired by physical yoga and poses from redundant revolutionary sculptures, created and performed by Lara Ritosa Roberts aka PK Fiskulturnik. Coined from ‘Yugoslavia’ – the country of artist’s birth that no longer exists – and ‘yoga’, the union, this performance revisits European communist cultural heritage whilst drawing a parallel between a real physical effort and determination of spirit.

Viewers are invited to join in at any point of performance and experience first-hand the act of live art embodiment.

Performed as both solo and a group piece in a variety of settings, *Yugo yoga...* has featured at many art events in the UK and abroad most notably at Tate Britain (2010), Museum of Yugoslav History, Belgrade, Serbia (2011) and Whitstable Biennale (2012). 

Lara Ritosa Roberts is a Croatian born, UK based visual and performance artist. She obtained an MA in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design in 2007, and has also trained as a sculptor and as a physical theatre performer. In 2007, Lara founded Performance Klub Fiskulturnik, an international collaborative live art project.
