A homage to Kurt Cobain, lost youth, impossible and failed encounters from a life lived retrospectively.

This solo performance is a story about 1994.    
A series of memory excerpts which intertwine the past with the present.    
An exploration of lost youth and ageing.    
A mix of historical, political and popular references (mention of the Balkan War and its atrocities, grunge and the suicide of Kurt Cobain) with personal autobiographical narratives (number of the boys I kissed, failed move to Seattle).    
A performative confession of a 37 year old woman who is remembering a 27 year old Kurt Cobain.    
This piece is about the troubling thrill of living life retrospectively.    

Lena Simic, performance practitioner and pedagogue, born in Dubrovnik, Croatia, living in Liverpool, UK. Co-organiser of The Institute for the Art and Practice of Dissent at Home, an art activist initiative run from her family home.
