A visual gathering of deeds to define feminism in the modern day.
        
*It is deeds that are needed, not words. We're just not sure what deeds they should be.*    

100 years ago, a woman did something which was considered by everyone to be truly heroic/irrational/essential/extremist/empowering/detrimental. When Emily Wilding Davison jumped in front of the King's horse, her action would go on to impact how a nation perceives feminism.    
 
Evans + Gaskell want to know what feminism means now, or perhaps what actions should happen next.  Come and tell them what you think and brand your own purple sash - they will try to turn your words into deeds (100 of them).    

Sarah Evans makes work which often has love and justice at its heart with a slice of comedy, sometimes light, sometimes dark (often weather dependent). She loves creating personal story-based pieces which linger. She loves working on one-to-one, intimate performances and giving little tokens of love.
