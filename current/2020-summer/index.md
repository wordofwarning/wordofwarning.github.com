#### About         
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that’s out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href=" http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
        
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond… including online.           
         
>*Consistently refreshing and surprising, no season is ever the same…*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://www.creativetourist.com/articles/theatre/manchester/manchester-theatre-lyn-gardner-on-a-city-reaching-beyond-the-theatrical-peaks" target="_blank">Creative Tourist on Manchester theatre (November 2014)</a>           
         
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past 8½ years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Amy Bell, Harry Clayton-Wright, Richard DeDomenici, Katy Dye, Nic Green, Stacy Makishi, Deborah Pearson, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, Proud & Loud Arts, amongst others. We've also created bonkers all ages live art ([Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org)), hosted [Hunt & Darton's pop-up art-café](/archive/2015-spring/h&d), unleashed bizarre behaviour upon Manchester's city centre ([Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org)), and created performance festivals in blocks of flats ([Domestic](/archive/2015-domestic)).

#### What            
We don't want to put you off by talking labels — yes, there'll be theatre, live art, dance, performance etc. — our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming, or just a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on.         
         
#### Feedback  
>*Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*<br>*Brave, dark, humerous, intimate, intense.*<br>*Heartwarming, funny + engaging.*<br>*Strangely mesmeric. A unique experience.*<br>*Very enjoyable — felt accessible and thus enjoyable to all.*<br>*You programme wonderful, daring performances that I have never been disappointed by.*          
         
#### Who         
My name's Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called [hÅb](/hab), which was greenroom's partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events — like [Emergency](http://emergencymcr.org) (Manchester's free marathon of live work, now in its twenty-first year) and [Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org) (biennial sprees of random eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).
         
>*Nights such as Works Ahead dismantle the idea of the arts being a wholly elitist industry, and create an environment of collaboration and conversation. Long may they continue.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/features/works-ahead-expect-something-weird-personal-entirely-half-done" target="_blank">The State of The Arts, on Works Ahead (May 2018)</a>                     
        
I've been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I've been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon *Hallelujah chorus*! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.<br><br>Please send programming enquiries to me at <mailto:info@habmcr.org><br><br>I'm joined by John Franklin-Johnston, greenroom's long time programme co-ordinator; we're grateful for the ongoing support of our occasional band of hÅbettes; thanks also to Megan McPhee for her marketing support during Summer 2020.
