####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Ashleigh Berry | The Space Between**          
A first-stage short film exploration created and directed by Ashleigh Berry, toying with the intersecting ideas of personal and public space. Examining space as a commodity in an ever-changing, ever-moving environment, the film questions when to 'hold space' as an individual, making a mark, and when to succumb to the bustle and become part of the background noise.

Concept + creation: Ashleigh Berry | Collaborators: Nicole Ward, Emma Fishwick | Project Mentor: Laura Boynes | Supported by Healthway, promoting the Drug Aware message, and Propel Youth Arts Western Australia.        
          
**Christopher Owen | Space is Only Noise**           
A live sound installation performance, designed to unpick and understand the structures between space and sound within the creative act.       
        
Choreographer + performer: Christopher Owen | Text: Marcel Duchamp on the artist and spectator.
