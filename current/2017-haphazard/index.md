Intriguing images + offbeat oddities dotted around the historic Z-arts' building with an April Fool's twist.

#### More        
[Haphazard 2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard) filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!); whilst [2015](/archive/2015-haphazard) saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!); [2016](/archive/2015-haphazard) saw ???  — why not join us to see what 2017 will conjure?
