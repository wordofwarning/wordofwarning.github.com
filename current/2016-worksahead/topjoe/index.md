*Presented by* Word of Warning + Contact        
           
*Part of* Works Ahead 2016 Evening Edition: from Dyson to the Passion — an unpredictable double bill from Top Joe + Lucy McCormick.      
         
#### In Brief                      
Top Joe is a timid character who wears a hi-vis jacket and only comes out at night. He occasionally braves leaving the house in order to meet people and give his thoughts on life, vouchers and pistachios.            
             
For Works Ahead he is developing a piece that explores the nature of Ross Kemp, Dyson vacuum cleaners, identity, comedy, and childhood.

#### More            
At the risk of missing a call back from prospective employers Pound Bakery, Top Joe is venturing out of the house.          
            
The hi-vis sporting Welshman is hoping it will be worth it as he shares his hopes, fears, 80s cassette collection and vitamin supplements with all who are equally as brave. Influenced by the Dalai Lama, his dad (deceased), and the great philosophers, this alternative comedy performance is not to be missed.          
            
*"Gaining cult status from performances at Latitude, Edinburgh…"* — hold on that was last year. A lot has changed in Top Joe's life since then. Top Joe is confused about the world around us. How is he coping with celebrity and his addiction to buffalo mozzarella on sliced tomatoes with basil leaves dressed in olive oil?             
             
Come and find out in this performance where things aren't quite what they seem.          
            
The old adage still stands: non-Michael Bolton fans will not be admitted.        
            
#### Who is he?                 
Top Joe is a confused man in a hi-vis jacket who only comes out at night. He's known for bringing misadventure to comedy and arts venues across the north-west, whether it's commandeering the mic at a children's festival in Leeds or causing a minor evacuation at an arts café in Liverpool. He also presents on local channel Bay TV Liverpool, and has appeared at Latitude, [Emergency](/archive/2015-emergency/evening), Edinburgh and a mobile sauna in Leeds.            
             
#### What people have said about him
