####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**SheepKnuckle (UK) | *A Brave and Startling Truth***     
An attempt to unravel the fragile ownership of words in a culture that freely expresses itself through social media. Blending live performance with a narrative that is built online, *A Brave and Startling Truth* is an attempt to engage with a world where you are more honest with your Google search bar than you are with your family.      
           
SheepKnuckle are James Monaghan + Padraig Confrey, who make work that manifests itself often as an experiment; who are interested in using interactive media and ‘the self’ to challenge and de-construct traditional dramaturgy. They are constantly looking for opportunities to broaden their creative outlets, searching for new ways/forms to present the ideas that inhabit their minds. They presented [*Echo*](/current/2014-worksahead/sheepknuckle) during Works Ahead 2014.

**Wies Fest (Netherlands) | *A whole lot of nothing***                
*We were born to do great things, but to tell the truth, we’d rather do nothing. And we must make sure that we’re all actually doing nothing, otherwise it would be an uneven battle. Thankfully we have the internet to keep an eye on each other.*             
             
A girl applies her make-up to look pretty, every day, and then she goes and tries to get as much attention as she can. She’s struggling, with real feelings and with her first world problems. And sometimes she forgets the difference between the two. The answer is this: nothing.          
        
Wies Fest graduated from the Acting Department in the School of the Arts Utrecht in 2013. *A whole lot of nothing* was performed at the ITs Festival in Amsterdam, was selected for the ITs hITs on Tour which was presented at 21 venues in the Netherlands and was nominated for ITs Parade Parel.       
                                
**El Conde De Torrefiel (Spain) | *Guerrilla***                
                      
There is an audience on stage, the audience at a scientific conference. There is a soundtrack, the voice of the speaker at the conference mixed with other sounds and music, manipulating the atmosphere. And there is text, projected above the heads of the on-stage audience, reflecting on the mental mechanisms of the viewer, and on Power in the 21st Century. How does Power affect us? How is it changing the way we build relationships? And why does it so often leave us leading a double life in our heads – the life that’s real and the life that we desire?                     
                         
El Conde de Torrefiel is based in Barcelona and led by Pablo Gisbert + Tanya Beyeler. Their performance pieces are the result of an oscillation between literature, art and choreography, and seek to transcend the parameters of verbal language. The company began in 2010 and have produced four theatre pieces since then.
