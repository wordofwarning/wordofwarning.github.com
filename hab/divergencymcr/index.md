From 28 April to 14 May 2014 [hÅb](/hab) and [STUN (Sustained Theatre Up North)](http://stunlive.com) are working together on **DivergencyMcr**, a [Creative Case NORTH](http://www.zendeh.com/blog/#announcement) residency project exploring diversity in live art and contemporary performance…         
          
**Live Art and the Creative Case** is an exploration into diversifying the northern artist base for live art + contemporary performance through: database research, artform tools + strategies workshop, and a group go-see visit.                     
        
STUN (a membership organisation dedicated to the development of UK Black and Asian Creatives) and hÅb have a joint goal of encouraging new ways of telling more diverse stories for new audiences — read our [blog](http://divergencymcr.posthaven.com) for progress, musings and ramblings throughout our residency.               
            
Creative Case NORTH is a programme of sector-led activity exploring the Creative Case for Diversity, developed by a consortium of arts and cultural organisations convened by Arts Council England from across the North area, including: Partners — ARC Stockton, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Contact Theatre, GemArts, STAY, ZENDEH; Critical Friends — Alchemy, Art House, Mind The Gap, Open Clasp, Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums.
