Experience illuminated memories through a stranger's ear and even have your own ear cast. An installation and interactive performance.    

Miyuki invites you to have your ear cast; it takes 15-20 minutes. After casting, you can email her a personal memory as an image or text that she will place inside a cast ear sculpture. This will become part of a future *his/her personal sky* installation.    
    
These ear sphere sculptures are also a floating presence around the space - you are encouraged to search for strangers' personal memories by looking into each ear hole. Shining a torch from behind creates a light-box effect, the inside illuminated as if another's secret memory just came to you.    

Miyuki Kasahara graduated with an MA from the Royal College of Art London. Her projects include *Message to me 2012* (2008-12) commissioned by Shoreditch Trust, London and *Trigger*, a solo exhibition at Art Gallery X, Tokyo (2007).
