### Saturday 20 February 2016, 12noon-4pm. FREE             
Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic Z-arts' building. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out! *Turn up at any time and come and go as you please.*

#### More        
[Haphazard 2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard) filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!); whilst [2015](/archive/2015-haphazard) saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!) — why not join us to see what 2016 will conjure?
