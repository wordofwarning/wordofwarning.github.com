####Artists + Activity (*subject to change*)        
**Artizani | *The Bees: Colony***        
Multiple handmade hives, each hiding an unexpected honey-scented world to challenge, charm and confound expectation. Tended by ethereal beekeepers, visitors participate in multi-sensory micro-experiences of sight, sound, taste, smell and touch.        
>*Bees!… has done much to raise the quality of outdoor performing arts… something different and distinctive* — Lyn Gardner, The Guardian        
        
**Doris La Trine | *Flushed!***        
Doris La Trine has finally come out the (water) closet, and is trying to say goodbye to her beloved giant golden toilet, Len, in this feminist visual and physical tragi-comedy.        
        
**Eilidh MacAskill + Rosana Cade | *Gendersaurus Rex: The Clothes Show***        
Meet the Gendersaurus Rex — the genial host of this gender-busting fashion show like no other… with dinosaurs.        
        
**Flipbook People | *Flipbook Live***        
Remember body flipbooks? Some of the characters have come to life! And you have an opportunity to join them as a flipbook character of your own creation: a 'swimming cowboy clown' or 'hula dancing doctor king'. It's up to you!        
        
**Gareth Cutter | *I Am A Volcano***        
A volcano is getting ready to erupt… active and ominous, this volcano isn't magma-powered but fuelled by voice alone. The more sounds you add the more unpredictable it becomes, in a collective climactic audience shout, hiss, or growl…        
        
**Katy Baird | *The Free Market***        
Katy is selling her entire wardrobe — in a bid to change herself. Don't bring cash, but bring your ideas and get rid of those February blues in this sale of the season. *Everything must go!*        
        
**Katy Dye | *RATS!***        
Crawling in our kitchens and blocking up our drainpipes, nibbling at our cornflakes and scratching at our doorsteps… dirty, smelly, flea-bitten, disease-ridden, ugly, amazing *RATS!* A performance that explores rodent reputation and tries to redress the balance — after all, it's a hard life being a rat!         
        
**Left Leg Gallery | *Crazy F.O.R.E***        
Crazy Golf meets action painting. Load your golf ball with paint and aim for a hole in one!        
        
**Lucy McCormick | *Animal Study***        
Part Disney film, part #LOLcat vine: Man is Dog, Woman is Cat but without the furry façade. A roaming challenge to sensible public behaviour.<br>*Can you see the kitty? Perhaps she is sitting on the wall. Oh look there's a doggy too, and he wants to play!*        
        
**Marcus Orlandi | *Two Reeler***
Inspired by the early era films of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, everyday household objects are misused, misunderstood and confused. Expect slapstick, awkwardness and tuneless song!        
         
**Matt Girling | *Pastures new***       
Watch the unfolding of a strange and exciting tiny world, ready to be inhabited by YOUR creativity.       
        
**Same Difference | *A Few Feet Up***         
Just above our heads is an entirely different and unexplored realm — always present but just out of reach. Use our giant periscope to see a familiar place anew for a literal and metaphorical change of perspective.        
        
**Travelling Lights | *Ludicrously Luminous***        
Digital meets steampunk in this mesmerising lightshow, as a helix of light colour and pattern swirls above your head. An eccentric trio of machines — re-fashioned beer pumps, an old laundry mangle and the mysterious Helical Morphosis Configurator — put the control in your hands.
