#### Who is he?        
Tom Cassani returns to parts-Mancunian after 2017's [deceptive exposé of deception itself](/archive/2017-worksahead/cassani). A Performance Artist and Liar, Tom is interested in how he can use elements of deception, misdirection, and lying in his artistic practice. Trained in sleight of hand, misdirection, and stage magic, Tom now uses those skills to explore truth, honesty, and the importance of remaining wary of those who make extraordinary claims.                  
        
#### What people have said about *I Promise You That Tonight*         
>*Often the eerie silence, combined with Cassani’s deliberately perfunctory performance, made the show uncomfortable viewing, and yet it was impossible to look away…*<br><a href="http://www.whatsonlive.co.uk/birmingham/news/our-be-festival-review-round-up/44721" target="_blank">★★★★ Ellie Hutchings, What's on Birmingham</a><br>*• Very accomplished performance. A powerful presence throughout.*<br>*• Beautiful, loved the eye contact. Exciting, vulnerable.*<br>Audience Feedback
