####More            
A tale of hubris, planes, demos and undercover deceit told by an award-winning performer. Ten years ago an activist and close friend of Mark's was exposed as a spy for BAE Systems, infiltrating the movement. Now Mark wants to find him and has some questions to ask. This is a true story.          
              
*Cuckooed* picks up from where the award-winning *Bravo Figaro* left off in style, using interviews from friends, colleagues, activists and journalists to examine the impact of betrayal. It is a personal and timely tale that tries to unearth what it means to be spied upon by a corporation under the sanction of the state.            
              
With plenty of laughs, some weird characters, documentary styles, probably a tear or two and the vague possibility that Mark might get beaten up in the making of it as he tries to find out if he wants revenge or if he can forgive a friend.            
              
####Who is he?    
An artist + performer based in Leeds, Selina's work is playful, participatory and intimate — focused on the politics of identity and how this defines our bodies, lives and environments. She has made work for pubs, cafes, hairdressers, toilets, and sometimes even galleries and theatres, including SPILL Festival of Performance, The National Theatre Studio, The Birmingham REP, East Street Arts and the West Yorkshire Playhouse.           
              
Over the past couple of years she's been developing a body of works, *Edible Women*, exploring the fat body, dieting, control around food, how much of a mess she can get away with creating with an audience, and a taste for excess; so far she has made a theatre show, built a dress out of cake, spent quite a lot of time listening to people confess their food sins and shared many of her own…
