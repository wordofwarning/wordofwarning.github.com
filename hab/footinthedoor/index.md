Following **<a href="http://divergencymcr.posthaven.com/divergencymcr-a-creative-case-north-residency-project" target="_blank">DivergencyMcr</a>** — a <a href="http://www.zendeh.com/blog/#announcement" target="_blank">Creative Case NORTH</a> residency exploring diversity in live art and contemporary performance, undertaken by <a href='http://habmcr.org' target='_blank'>hÅb</a> + <a href='http://stunlive.com' target='_blank'>STUN</a> (Sustained Theatre Up North) in 2014 — we were delighted to receive Grants for the Arts funding to continue the project…        
           
During 2015/16 Divergency organised a series of meals, discussions, workshops, sharings and performances with a group of local artists and a series of visiting artists — the first public performance being [Ria Hartley's *Matilda and Me*](/archive/2015-springsummer/hartley) on 25 June 2015 in STUN's Studio. Coming soon is an [evening of tabletop performances, installations + sit-down shows](/current/2016-divergency) at Z-arts (incl. STUN Studio) on 6 October 2016 featuring Maya Chowdhry, Jamil Keating, Chanje Kunda, Afreena Islam, Cheryl Martin, Chelsea Morgan, Toni-Dee Paul and Yvonne Shelton.
