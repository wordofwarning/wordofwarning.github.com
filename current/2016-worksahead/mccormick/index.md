#### More              
Lording it over western thought and stereotype, this show is a frenzied right of passage which is as enthusiastic as it is volatile.       

Casting herself in all the main roles, Lucy will attempt to re-connect to her own moral conscience by re-enacting old biblical stories via a nu-wave holy trinity of dance, power ballads and performance art. With trademark absurdism and enthusiasm, Lucy puts her best foot forward in the face of existential deadlock.           
             
#### Who is she?
