####More            
*Near Gone* is a heartfelt story about survival.                 
                 
Two performers have a difficult story to tell. They come on stage and launch themselves into an hour long attempt to put into words the utterly unspeakable.                 

Delivered in English and Bulgarian, with fantastic gypsy-inspired music, this performance fills an empty space with two performers and 400 fresh flowers. It transforms you too, your sense of what it is to be a mother, a father, a child. And you’ll leave more fully alive than ever.
