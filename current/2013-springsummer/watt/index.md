*Presented by* Contact + Word of Warning 

####In Brief
*the larger the crowd, the less likely it is that anyone will intervene...*    
 
We’ve all seen it happen. We’ve all heard it happen. We’ve all crossed the road to avoid it. We’ve all stood by. We’ve all hoped it would stop.    
 
A sweet and poetic show with a powerful message, Flâneurs explores the nature of violence in public spaces.    

**Winner of Scotsman Fringe First Award 2012.**

####More    
Inspired by a close friend of Jenna's who was attacked and mugged in London twice during 2010, *Flâneurs* is a story of friendship, violence and intervention. Shocked to discover that there were bystanders during one of these attacks, Jenna struggles to understand what prevents witnesses of violent acts from protesting and asks whether 'one punch is enough' to provoke intervention.    

Using psycho-geography and real accounts of violent acts, *Flâneurs* explores the nature of violence on our streets and attempts to deconstruct the 'bystander effect'.    

####Who is she?
Jenna Watt is a an award winning Live Artist / Theatre Maker/ Director originally from Inverness and currently living and working in Edinburgh, Scotland.    

She creates multi-disciplinary works that combine the practice of live art and more traditional theatrical forms and is best known for creating works that explore risk, violence and interaction.  *Flâneurs* gained a Scotsman Fringe First in 2012 after its run at Summerhall during the Edinburgh Fringe. Her live art happening *It's Ok, It's Only Temporary (the apple smashing piece)* gained her notoriety after she was temporarily banned from a Scottish venue but went on to tour the UK to venues including Forest Fringe, The Basement, Brighton, Out of the Blue, Edinburgh and Camden People's Theatre, London.   

As a Director, Jenna has worked on a variety of projects including large scale projects, directing professional actors, learning disabled adults and young people. In Autumn 2011, Jenna was part of the New Directors initiative with the National Theatre of Scotland where she worked as assistant director with Vicky Featherstone on Abi Morgan's *27*.

>*a richly thoughtful show*\*\*\*\*<br> The Scotsman  
  
>*utterly charming and surprisingly light-hearted.*<br> The Stage    
   
>*Give Jenna Watt an hour of your time, a projector and a toy giraffe: she'll change your whole outlook. Immense.*<br>Fringe Biscuit    

>*That casual air of Watt's stage presence, however, conflicts violently with the questions she is forcing us all to ask ourselves: Am I a bystander, or am I a flâneur? These questions lead to a twist ending that will truly leave you dizzied.*<br>Broadway World
