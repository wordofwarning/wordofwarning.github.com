### Friday 22 + Saturday 23 April 2016, 7.30pm
Celebrating five years of this whirlwind of dance at Contact, Turn's two day spin around new northern dance sees energy burst from every nook and cranny…           
        
Fluidly lyrical, effervescently acrobatic or eccentrically innovative, let Turn transport you into a frenzy of dance.
