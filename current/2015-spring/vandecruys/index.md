####More    
A pair of performances about being human (and being a horse) from Belgian theatre-maker Leentje Van de Cruys + University of Salford collaborators…           

***HORSE*** is a story about a woman who thinks she's a horse. But the real problem is that she thinks she is a different horse from the one she is. *HORSE* is about what it takes to fit in, to make yourself look beautiful to other people, to be loved and accepted, despite everything…                
                      
***Whoaaaaa Steady!** (working title)*: the British are weird. Take, for example, the racecourse: an intriguing world full of unexpected characters: 'enthusiasts, horseys, addicts, anoraks, socials, pair-bonders, suits and be-seens'.                  
                      
It's fascinating to observe some intriguing abnormalities in the body language, rituals, etiquette and behaviour of the racing crowds. Inspired by anthropologist Kate Fox's book *The Racing Tribe*, we will be watching the horse-watchers, and start to make a show… A show about horses, humans and… well, being British (and weird). Giddy-up!
