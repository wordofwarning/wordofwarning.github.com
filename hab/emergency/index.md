**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, featuring at least 25 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester…        
        
The call for proposals is now closed and selection underway for our **seventeenth Emergency** which will take place on Saturday 1 October 2016 (12noon-10pm) at [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here) (including the STUN Studio), Manchester. To get a feel for it, have a look at [2015's image gallery](/galleries/2015-emergency) or 2014's [gallery](/galleries/2014-emergency) + [programme](http://www.wordofwarning.org/archive/2014-emergency).
