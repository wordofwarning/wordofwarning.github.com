**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into all ages live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org)' building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!
        
**In [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard)** we filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!) — **[2015](/archive/2015-haphazard)** saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!); to get a feel for it have a look at [2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard) + [2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard) images.       
        
Our **[third Haphazard](/current/2016-haphazard)** takes over Z-arts on Saturday 20 February 2016, with audiences coming and going as they please between 12noon and 4pm. This is NOT live art for children but live art for ALL ages, with the day appealing to adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!).<br>Using a variety of spaces — from black box to gallery to café — the programme (tba) emphasis will be more on durational and 'come and go' work than traditional black-box shows (*N.B. the proposal call out has closed*).         
        
[Haphazard 2016](/current/2016-haphazard) is presented by Word of Warning + Z-arts; produced by hÅb + Z-arts; supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council; supported by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Breakthrough Fund.
