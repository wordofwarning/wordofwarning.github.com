A one-woman evening-length performance; a powerful fusion of theatre, music, film and text.

####More
Inspired by the film *FARGO*, which proclaims in its prologue "this is a true story". Hawaii-born Makishi finally "comes out" and tells the whole truth behind an elliptical tale.

Weaving between the real and the fake, the unbelievable real and the believable fake, and sampling excerpts from *FARGO* along the way, Makishi takes us on an uncanny, hilarious and enjoyably disorientating journey.  There's an element of audience participation involving an incident with a doughnut and a 'post-show' Q&A built directly into the structure of the show itself.

What's it got to do with *FARGO*?

*FARGO* revolves around a lie around a kidnap, which instigates an extraordinary series of events, including the burial of a suitcase filled with a million-dollar ransom along the border of Fargo, North Dakota.

In a strange interplay between fact and fiction , the following story appeared in the London Guardian on 6 June, 2003:
*"… a twenty-eight year old woman left Tokyo to travel to Fargo. The police spotted her wandering around the outskirts of the state and when they questioned her, she showed them 'a crude map' that was supposed to show where the ransom money was hidden in the movie, Fargo.  The police said "we tried to explain to her that it was a fictional movie.  It wasn't really true.  There really wasn't any ransom, no million dollars hidden in the snow" The woman could not be deterred from her strange quest.  Her frozen body was found in the woodland on a road between Fargo and Brainerd, a crumpled map still clenched in her hand."*

Inspired by the strange twists surrounding the mythology of *FARGO*, *The Making of Bull: The True Story* unravels mysteries… including mysteries of why we make art and how art makes us.  It questions what's real and what's fake, and our attachment to the notion of truth.   

*Running Time:* 50 minutes
