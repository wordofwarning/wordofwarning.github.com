####More   
With a post modern nod to a by-gone era *Domestic Appliances* is a glimpse into the warped reality of this wistful wife. Tethered to her white goods she goes about her mundane tasks, a pristine parody of the feminine.        
         
Is she one teaspoon short of a cutlery draw or has she enlisted some soporific medicinal assistance? We're never quite sure.        
        
The piece tinkers with (wo)man and machine, the merging of body and object in a setting charged with gender signifiers. The Body undergoes a minor trauma in order to complete a function as part of machine but any 'trauma' that the audience might feel witnessing this will be undercut by Betty's choice of soundtrack and her sheer ambivalence to the action.    
   
####Who is she?    
Liz Clarke is a live artist. Her work is primarily concerned with the Body as Site and Object; exploring its boundaries and vulnerabilities in performance. Practicing in the spaces between theatre, cabaret and live art she questions what happens when the genres' unwritten rules are broken, merged, unclassified, exploited. Her work is strongly connected with representing the Female through alienation, intimacy and construction of mythical Hyperfeminine archetypes. She has performed at In Between Time, Arnolfini, Duckie, Roundhouse, Appetite, Shunt, ]PerformanceSpace[, Mayfest, on stages, understairs, in cars, giant balloons & nightclubs world-wide. She is resident performer & mentor with Beacons Icons & Dykons.        
        
Through her socially engaged practice with Liz Clarke & Company she encourages people to take supported risks through performance and facilitates the creation new work. Her latest work *Cannonballista* charts the rise and fall of her Super Hero Alter Ego Betty Bruiser, whilst inviting participants from the local community to take to the stage with her through a series of intensive workshops. *Cannonballista* has shown at Arnolfini and Appetite Festival in 2014 and Trinity 2015.
