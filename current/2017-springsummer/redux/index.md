#### More
Join Richard DeDomenici in his attempt to remake several minutes of the iconic 2002 Manchester movie *24 Hour Party People*…        
        
Since 2013 DeDomenici's inexplicably popular *Redux Project* has caused a stir over sixty times, in places as diverse as 
London, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney, Beijing, and Milton Keynes. The project celebrates and subverts the cultural heritage of the places it visits, by attempting to make shot-for-shot remakes of scenes from famous films + TV, on a shoe-string budget with amateur local crews, in the same locations where the originals were filmed.         
       
In November 2015 DeDomenici adapted *The Redux Project* for television as part of the BBC4 event <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038bxhz" target="_blank">*On Stage: Live from Television Centre*</a> — described by journalist Matt Trueman as "<a href="http://twitter.com/matttrueman/status/666028504119648256" target="_blank">one of the smartest, strangest subversive half hours of television I've ever seen</a>"         
         
The project's second visit to Manchester — following May 2016's [*Queer As Yolk*](/archive/2016-springsummer/redux) with Eggs Collective — returns *Redux* HOME with Word of Warning for a glittering World Première.           
         
#### Who is he?        
Richard DeDomenici makes work that is social, joyful, topical and political — although rarely simultaneously. He specialises in urban-absurdist interventions which strive to create the kind of uncertainty that leads to possibility.
