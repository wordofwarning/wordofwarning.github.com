#### Who is he?        
Darren Pritchard has been creating dance works since 2006. As well as devising his own works, for theatres, galleries, a church, hotels and even the Sale of the Century TV studio, Darren has created dance works for and in collaboration with others, notably: *The Chase* — a Blaze commission, working with parkour and freerunning specialists; *Susan and Darren* — a Quarantine collaboration; *Gulliver's Boom Box* with Walk the Plank; *One* — a solo performance installation; and [*Body of Light*](/archive/2015-autumnwinter/pritchard) — a seamless landscape of flowing imagery that Word of Warning presented in 2015. Stylistically, Darren has explored ballet, street dance and contemporary dance, sometimes fused with text, projection and other multimedia forms, and has recently worked as director on Chanje Kunda's award-winning *Amsterdam* + Cheryl Martin's *Alaska*.
