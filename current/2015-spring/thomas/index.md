*FAT! That's what I'm making a show about. My fat. Your fat, maybe. Fat. I've been fat for a long time now, and I thought I was fat, even when I wasn't, and as such, I've been thinking about fat for even longer. So I made a show about it. Our bodies and egos are fragile, our ways of talking about them inadequate, so I can understand that you might not be up for talking about fat for an hour.*        
        
*So I'll make you some promises:*       
*• I promise to tell the truth†;*        
*• I promise to make it funny†;*        
*• I promise you won't get any mess on your nice clothes†;*        
*• I promise not to talk about anorexia, bulimia, fat acceptance, the beauty myth, feminism, the fashion industry, weight loss, the diet industry, discrepancies between the European ideal of beauty and the Afro-Carribbean ideal of beauty, girls being bitchy to other girls, how men feel about their body, about how you should feel about your body†;*        
*• I promise that your body is a Wonderland (copyright John Mayer) and so is mine†.*       
*† I can't guarantee that any of these promises will be kept.*        
*p.s. Bring snacks.*        
        
Selina invites you to her own version of a midnight feast: somewhere between confessions made over coffee at Weight Watchers, and sloppy drunken story-telling over a 3am kebab. She infuses discussion of complex, life-long issues with weight with laughter, popping balloons and a healthy dose of rice pudding to result in something truly vibrant. Sitting somewhere between story-telling, stand-up, live art and theatre, *Chewing The Fat* is a powerful and extremely open portrayal of how we live with our bodies, on both the days when they are beautiful, and the days when they are a burden.          
             
####Who is she?    
An artist + performer based in Leeds, Selina's work is playful, participatory and intimate — focused on the politics of identity and how this defines our bodies, lives and environments. She has made work for pubs, cafes, hairdressers, toilets, and sometimes even galleries and theatres, including SPILL Festival of Performance, The National Theatre Studio, The Birmingham REP, East Street Arts and the West Yorkshire Playhouse.           
              
Over the past couple of years she's been developing a body of works, *Edible Women*, exploring the fat body, dieting, control around food, how much of a mess she can get away with creating with an audience, and a taste for excess; so far she has made a theatre show, built a dress out of cake, spent quite a lot of time listening to people confess their food sins and shared many of her own…          
              
####What people have said about him
