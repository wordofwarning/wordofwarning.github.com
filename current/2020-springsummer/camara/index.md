*Presented by* STUN *+* Word of Warning       
         
#### In Brief      
'Oreo, coconut, Bounty Bar' — micro-aggressions used to disempower a black person deemed to be 'acting white'. Donning a camouflage of Oreo-filling, Tania explores the masks we wear to put our heads above the parapet in a climate of systemic racism.

#### More         
A semi-autobiographical solo about being a successfully educated black woman within western society, *Oreo* interrogates racial micro-aggressions and their effect on mental health within private and public personas — focusing on public figures like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott" target="_blank">Diane Abbott</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joacine_Katar_Moreira" target="_blank">Joacine Katar Moreira</a>.<br><br>Exploring the racial term 'Oreo' in relation to experiences of episodic racism within higher education and employment, Tania challenges the notion of whitening her physical and phenomenal self to achieve success in society, asking you to open-up and join-in to celebrate a moment of freedom, a moment of clarity.       
         
#### Who is she?        
A Manchester-based solo performance artist, Tania Camara works across devised theatre, dance, site-specific, live art, installation, video + photography. A graduate of the University of Amsterdam with an MA, she uses her cultural heritage, past experiences, research + the interdisciplinary structure of Batuku (incl. singing, dancing, drums + spoken word). Tania's current practice focuses on personal accounts of memory, collective and ancestral, to uncover her racial and cultural identity; the concept of self and other; belonging and the black performing body.
