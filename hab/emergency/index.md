Somewhat of an institution in these parts, **Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance featuring up to 40 short pieces of work in a single day, across a number of Manchester venues.     
     
To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2012 [archive](/archive/2012-emergency) and [gallery](/galleries/2012-emergency).    

Our [fourteenth Emergency](/current/2013-emergency) takes place on **Saturday 5 October 2013**, at [BLANKSPACE](http://blankmediacollective.org/about-us/) (12-4pm) and [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org) (3-11pm).

>a free public micro-festival;   
>an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work;      
>a selection event for a number of small Works Ahead commissions to be developed & supported by hÅb;
