#### More         
In 1956, there was a popular uprising against the USSR in Hungary. The battle was fought primarily from the Corvin Cinema, and the uprising lead to one of the largest refugee crises of the twentieth century. In a live commentary screening of a 1956 comedy about football, scheduled to premiere at the Corvin Cinema the week of the uprising, Deborah Pearson unlocks a surprisingly personal story.        

Using the film as material, Pearson creates a live documentary onstage. Her words form a counterpoint to the movie, fusing the political, the historical and the achingly personal. Riveting, haunting and ultimately inspiring, this is a show for lovers of cinema, and for anyone who has stared at pictures of their ancestors a little too long.         
        
#### Who is she        
A live artist and playwright, Deborah Pearson's work has toured to four continents and fifteen countries, and has been translated into five languages; she recently published *The Future Show* with Oberon books. A founding co-director of UK artist collective Forest Fringe, Deborah has won awards for both her solo practice and her work with Forest Fringe — including three Herald angels, a Scotsman Fringe First, a Peter Brooke Empty Space Award, and the Total Theatre Award for Significant Contribution.           
           
An associate artist with Volcano in Canada, she was a resident artist for two years at Somerset House Studios with Caroline Williams and is now an associate artist at Somerset House Studios with Forest Fringe.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
