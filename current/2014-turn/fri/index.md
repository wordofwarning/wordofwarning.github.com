####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Ashleigh Berry | The Space Between**          
A first-stage short film exploration created and directed by Ashleigh Berry, toying with the intersecting ideas of personal and public space. Examining space as a commodity in an ever-changing, ever-moving environment, the film questions when to 'hold space' as an individual, making a mark, and when to succumb to the bustle and become part of the background noise.

Concept + creation: Ashleigh Berry | Collaborators: Nicole Ward, Emma Fishwick | Project Mentor: Laura Boynes | Supported by Healthway, promoting the Drug Aware message, and Propel Youth Arts Western Australia.        
          
**Percussive Customer Projects | Space is Only Noise**           
A live sound installation performance, designed to unpick and understand the structures between space and sound within the creative act.       
        
Choreographer + performer: Christopher Owen | Text: Marcel Duchamp on the artist and spectator.

**Jenny Reeves + Annelies Van Hijfte | It's a song story**

**Ellen Turner | Trudy**           
*Once someone has gone, is that it? The end?*       
         
Involuntary autobiographical memory is a subcomponent of memory that occurs when cues are encountered in everyday life; these could be reflected in certain smells, words, colours or tastes. Award-winning choreographer Ellen Turner collaborates for the first time, with her sisters; reflecting memories of their Grandmother, and Alzheimer’s sufferer, *Trudy*.

Supported by Live at LICA

 **Jo Ashbridge | Mental Time Travel**        
'Mental time travel' refers to the casting of the mind back into the past, or forwards into the future; everyone experiences this to some degree, but for some it is difficult to control and takes the mind into some very unusual places. The piece explores this and takes it to the extreme — looking at it from a dark, but at times humorous, perspective.
