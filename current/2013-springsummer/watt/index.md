*Presented by* Contact + Word of Warning 

####In Brief
*the larger the crowd, the less likely it is that anyone will intervene...*    
 
We’ve all seen it happen. We’ve all heard it happen. We’ve all crossed the road to avoid it. We’ve all stood by. We’ve all hoped it would stop.    
 
A sweet and poetic show with a powerful message, Flâneurs explores the nature of violence in public spaces.    

**Winner of Scotsman Fringe First Award 2012.**
