*Part of* Domestic II, *presented by* Word of Warning + The Guinness Partnership.      
         
####In Brief                      
A new solo show exploring the personal and shared experiences of growing up as one of the ‘feral underclass’ in relation to today's 'Austerity Britain'. 
Fleas, cheap clothes, thrifty bread, cold baths, and debauched disadvantaged dancing will be investigated as I chart the drive for survival and fitting in.    

Stories and songs about how to get by and make do will be shared whilst I attempt to overcome the shame of bareness and celebrate our spirit of community and hope.
