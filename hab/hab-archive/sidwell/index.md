Chorlton based performance poet Robin Sidwell writes poems for the people and reads them to the people, his people, for he is the people's poet.      
Come and listen, he's not saying the work will change the world completely ... but it will a little bit!             

*"Oh that thing in the news? Yeah man, that was awful wasn't it! Probably write a poem about it, that's just what I do!"* (Sidwell 20/08/12)    

Former greenroom associate artist with theatre company Until Thursday, and Method Lab artist as Robin Sidwell.
