**Turn 2017**, our ninth annual platform for North West dancers + dance-makers, is calling for proposals. Taking place on **Friday 28 (public programme) + Saturday 29 April (artist day) 2017** at Manchester's Contact, Turn 2017 is a hÅb, Contact, Dance Manchester + Manchester Dance Consortium co-production.    
  
North West* dancers and dance-makers (aged 18+) are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this annual event. To get a feel for it, have a look at the [2016 programme](/archive/2016-turn) + [gallery](/galleries/2016-turn).   
 
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 3 March 2017.**     
   
**Turn:**    
An open submission dance platform for North West* dancers + dance-makers on Fri 28 April:    
● short finished pieces;      
● excerpts;    
● works in progress;    
● sited works in and around the building also welcomed.   
**plus** an artist day, incorporating workshops, masterclasses and feedback sessions on Sat 29 April.     

Participating artists will be expected to attend both.    
The artist day will be a taster for the forthcoming MDC Choreolab - a week long artist development programme taking place at Contact in July 2017.    

Proposals should be for pieces with some live presence, 20 minutes maximum for show-type work, technically simple, adaptable to quick turnarounds and suitable for showing alongside other pieces.    
Sited and intervention-based works in and around the venue (Contact) are also strongly encouraged.    
We are also accepting proposals for video based work to be screened around the building.     
* *effectively Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire + Merseyside: **NOT** Yorkshire*    

**Turn:**      
● a public platform;    
● an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work;    
● an artist networking event;    
● a selection platform for a series of bursaries for the Manchester Dance Consortium Choreolab (July 2017).      

We are looking for dance in any form which uses the artists' creativity, has strong concept, original choreography and professional aspiration. We welcome work which explores forms beyond Contemporary - including radical re-imaginings of classical non-western forms. In 2017 we are particularly interested in contemporary work which explores the boundaries between dance and live art.    
 
Priorities are for high quality and exciting dance based work by North West* artists, which has not been seen in Manchester before.    
 
**To apply:**     
1. Read the venue (Contact)'s [tech specs](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/contact-tech-specs) + [policies and procedures](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/policies-and-procedures-14138);    
2. Complete and submit the [proposal](https://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/turn-2017-proposal-form) + [monitoring](http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form) forms    
(Direct form links: https://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/turn-2017-proposal-form + http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form);    
3. Include a short (compulsory) video submission — upload to your own YouTube/Vimeo or similar page and include the link in the proposal form; alternatively send via [wetransfer.com](http://www.wetransfer.com) (or similar) to <mailto:turn@habmcr.org> OR send a DVD to: hÅb, c/o Z-arts, 335 Stretford Road, Manchester, M15 5ZA. Video should be short (max 10 mins) and does not have to be high quality. It can be from a camcorder, digital camera or mobile phone. It really helps your proposal if you can show some of what you are proposing — rehearsal footage or a video sketch of ideas and style.        
N.B. We would appreciate it if everyone could use the online form, but if you have significant difficulties contact <mailto:turn@habmcr.org> for an offline version.    
  
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 3 March 2017.**    
  
**Notes:**    
● The proposal form must be completed at one sitting (you can't save and return to it later) so please copy and paste the longer elements from another document.    
● Turn 2016 will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses for NW artists.    
● There will be a **technical meeting for ALL selected artists on Saturday 22 April 2017 (daytime)**.    
● Enquiries: <mailto:turn@habmcr.org> | <http://turnmcr.org> | #TurnMcr    
        
Taking place at Contact on 28 + 29 April 2019, Turn 2017 is presented by Word of Warning + Contact; co-produced by hÅb, Contact, Dance Manchester + Manchester Dance Consortium; supported using public funding through Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council.
