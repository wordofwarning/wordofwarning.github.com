#### Who is she?     
A Glasgow-based performance artist, FK's practice is concerned with issues of wounds, recovery, aggressive healing, radical wellness, industrialisation and noise music. Her work predominantly puts her body at the centre of ritualised, action based, often durational work, in often ridiculous attempts to communicate ideas around new language, new violence and new love.       
         
Often collaborating with a range of live artists and noise musicians, FK's work finds its home in outdoor performances, studio work, nightclubs and noise music gigs; as a former DJ, FK is interested in placing performance art in rock and roll settings and rock and roll in performance art.
