#### About         
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that’s out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href=" http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
        
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond… including online.           
            
>*Consistently refreshing and surprising, no season is ever the same…*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://www.creativetourist.com/articles/theatre/manchester/manchester-theatre-lyn-gardner-on-a-city-reaching-beyond-the-theatrical-peaks" target="_blank">Creative Tourist on Manchester theatre (November 2014)</a>           
         
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all.<br>Over the past 8½ years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Amy Bell, Harry Clayton-Wright, Richard DeDomenici, Nic Green, Stacy Makishi, Deborah Pearson, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, Proud & Loud Arts, amongst others. We've also created [Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org) all-ages live art, hosted [Hunt & Darton's pop-up art-café](/archive/2015-spring/h&d), and unleashed [Hazardous](http://hazardmcr.org) happenings upon Manchester's city centre.         
         
#### Audiences         
>*Nights such as Works Ahead dismantle the idea of the arts being a wholly elitist industry, and create an environment of collaboration and conversation. Long may they continue.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/features/works-ahead-expect-something-weird-personal-entirely-half-done" target="_blank">The State of The Arts, on Works Ahead (May 2018)</a>                 
         
We don't want to put you off by talking labels — yes, there'll be theatre, live art, dance, performance etc. — our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming, or just a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on.

#### Who         
Word of Warning is a project by [hÅb](/hab) — you may not have heard of us, but you might know some of our events — like [Emergency](http://emergencymcr.org) (Manchester's free marathon of live work, now in its twenty-first year) and [Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org) (biennial sprees of random eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).<br><br>Based in Manchester, [hÅb](/hab) was greenroom's key partner for over a decade and aims to maintain its legacy — we produce, develop, and advocate for, contemporary performance, live art, and sited work in the North of England. We're supported using public funding by Arts Council England, a Greater Manchester Artist Hub partner, and a Live Art UK member.

Tamsin Drury, our Director, has been around a while — a really long while — she's been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, encouraging a mass audience conga to Oxford Rd Station, and firing a glitter-cannon to the *Hallelujah* chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has worked with hundreds of NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.
