Follow the artist on screen and in person along mirrored pathways that suddenly turn upside down, through impossible forests of black paper, past looming geometric constructions. And just when you think you are getting your bearings, the artist remakes the landscape ahead of you.    

Stephanie Douet exhibits sculpture, performance and installation at various UK venues including the De La Warr Pavillion, V&A, Outpost Norwich, Kraak Manchester and home London. She is currently exhibiting in *Sinopticon* at National Trust's Saltram House and Plymouth Museum. Douet also co-curates the Queen of Hungary Project Space.
