h√Öb maintains the [EmergencyNW e-group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/emergencynw/) for artists working in live art, contemporary performance and dance in the north west.  Current members include everyone who has performed at one of our platform events (current membership 286!)

We forward information and opportunities to this group, both our own projects and information we think may be useful; and members can post messages, call outs etc.  We also organise workshare opportunities through the group.
