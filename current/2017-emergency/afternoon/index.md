**Eliza Soroga | *The Oppression of Intimacy***         
Taking its cue from Artaud's statement, "*theatre should be a mirror of life*", this performance challenges the role of the individual and its relation to the role of the crowd, creating an emotional dissonance between subject and object. Borrowing elements from the controlled and composed language of cinema, which, when fed back to an audience makes them both voyeur and object, depending on the gaze.               
Music: *In a Landscape*, John Cage | Photos: Alisa Oleva

Is money who we are?*" — Ali Smith, How To Be Both.

**Jamal Gerald | *You See…***         
I am usually vocal about what I see. But for once, I'm just going to ask questions and stay quiet whilst you answer them. I am interested in seeing the world through the eyes of your experiences. I just want to ask you questions. Please, share with me what you see. I want to know what you see. I want you to know what you see. I can't promise you that all of my questions will be nice, but don’t you worry. Just remember, it's all about you, and what you see.<br>"*…both thoughtful and thought provoking, carefully and quietly challenging of the assumptions we don’t notice ourselves make.*" — Alexander Kelly, Third Angel.

**Laura Napier | *Reject***

**M. Valcarcel-Saez | *alien-lost.party***          
The idea of extraterrestrial civilisations conjures cosmic interplanetary intelligence. Yet, in Western societies the alien stands for the migrant, estranged stranger who doesnt naturally belong in the nation. There is no escape from the artificial for the alien; its naturalisation a fiction, the foreign body holds on to its defining marks, manifest even in the immaterial of its sound waves. Still, alienation is not foreign to the native population. Identity crises grow with the pace of technological advancement as the alien is revealed to be as digital as it is mechanical. Conceptions of authentic living and synthetic loving agitate notions of existence and being, us, all. When did we become strangers, stranded on the shores of identity? In the sheltered society, the alien(ated) play the theatre of be-longing, undisguised.

**Paula Davy & Gilda Lockheart | *Dolls House***          
Inspired by Gilda's childhood trauma inflicted by her abusive, alcoholic mother, and Paula's desire to conform to and fit in within the constraints of a heterosexual mainstream culture, this piece is a re-enaction of childhood trauma and a desperate attempt to achieve closure and recovery through the mutilation and repair of dolls.

**Peter Jacobs | *At Night I Lock The Doors***             
A silent disco for a group of men alone together. Blurring the boundaries between public and private acts, the piece considers the meaning of privacy and freedom in a world of increasingly detailed surveillance and scrutiny of ordinary people through social media and government legislation. Is it still possible to lock the doors — and who really has the key?

**Rampant | *Questions of England***            
"*What does he of England know who only England knows?*"<br>A random collection of questions. Simple in concept, the range of ideas it evokes is entirely in the hands of the experience of the audience. Listen for as long as you like, take from it what you will. The chances are you will think of England slightly differently.
            
**Mark Reid** is a local writer and theatre activist, producing work on the alternative theatre scene in Manchester for many years. He has recently spent a year writing a play a week, and exploring audience interactive work with *Hamlet* and *Brutality*.            
             
**Vijay Patel | *Asperger's Question Time***             
A participatory performance which aims to create a safe space for those with Asperger's and those without. The audience are taken through a playful journey into the Asperger's mind and offered a space to have their wildest questions answered… perhaps with a more obscure answer. It is forced social interaction and we must support each other through it.

**Zoe Toolan | *Be"Spoke" Cards***            
Greetings cards are universally understood as a way of celebrating specific occasions. But more often than not, it's the occasion-defying co/incidental moments that are the ones worth celebrating: spilling tea all over your duvet results in a life changing encounter at the launderette, or being at a different part of your work commute because of a wrongly set alarm means that a lost dog is reunited with his owner. So I invite you to share these unique moments by joining me for a 1-2-1 chat where we'll celebrate it — and you — through the collaborative making of a personal and be"spoke" card.                
          
**Zoe Toolan** is a multidisciplinary artist from the north, now living in Brighton. Social interaction, the nature of experience and our relationship with 'things' are recurring themes within her work, and she also regards any workshop she hosts in her role as art tutor or whisky professional as a time-based, participatory happening. Her projects have been shown at various locations including Secret Garden Party, she has a piece in the Sluice archive, and she was recently selected as a lead artist for a Live Art Development Agency DIY. She is currently a fine art tutor at the Art Academy in London.
