###Friday 3 + Saturday 4 June 2016        
Our annual sampler of what's next in contemporary performance and live art — pushing the boundaries of form and content. To date, Works Ahead has brushed the petticoats of dance, skirted the fringes of musical theatre, warped the lines of performance installation, delved into the mindset of the performer, and questioned manliness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era…         
         
2016 sees four new works in development:        
PERFORMANCES from Lucy McCormick + Top Joe        
INTERACTIONS from Afreena Islam + Terri Donovan
