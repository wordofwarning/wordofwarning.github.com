### Thursday 16 + Friday 17 May 2019, 7.30pm        
Our annual sampler of new performance is a double bill of new works in development from Emma Geraghty + Vijay Patel: a girl and a guitar, a boy and a box of questions… An evening unpicking the complexity of identity and celebrating the difference. Now that it's over, see [images](/galleries/2018-woah) from the event, and read a review by <a href="http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/features/works-ahead-expect-something-weird-personal-entirely-half-done" target="_blank">The State of The Arts</a>.           
            
To get a feel for Works Ahead 2019, have a look at [2018's programme](/archive/2018-worksahead).        
        
Works Ahead is also seed-commissioning Jamal Gerald's *Complexion* — exploring the historic experiences of the house and the field slaves; and drawing a parallel with contemporary pop culture and attitudes to race. Being developed for 2019 in partnership with Transform in Leeds.

#### What people have said about Works Ahead        
>*A cathartic, funny and brutally honest show about bodies, particles and the universe.*<br><a href="http://afronalysis.com/2017/05/14/review-superposition-stun" target="_blank">Afronalysis (2017 review)</a>           
>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless …make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*<br><a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave (2016 review)</a>           
>• *Brilliant platform for emerging talent.<br>• Great to see new work by younger artists.<br>• Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.<br>• I enjoyed both shows even though they were very different. I look forward to seeing how they develop.*<br>[Audience feedback from 2017](/archive/2017-worksahead)/[16](/archive/2016-worksahead)/[15](/archive/2015-worksahead)
