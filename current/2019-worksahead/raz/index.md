*Presented by* Word of Warning, Contact + STUN *in* [Works Ahead 2019](/current/2019-worksahead) *as a double bill with* [Mark Croasdale](/current/2019-worksahead/croasdale)               
         
#### In Brief        
A solo performance derived from a song. A politically charged tale of a drunken one night stand, infused with stories of growing up in the turmoil of 80s Israel. A nuanced exploration of the politics of division, from internal checkpoints and separation walls to gender norms.           
         
Can we go beyond the blame game to really see each other?

#### More          
>*Even though I have lived in Israel nearly my entire life, I am constantly questioning my place in the world. Maybe this searching comes from being an artist, maybe it comes from being a Jew. I'm not really sure.* — Chava Alberstein, songwriter.
        
With the escalation in violence after Trump declared Jerusalem to be the Jewish capital; questions of antisemitism in the Labour Party; rising levels of awareness of the Palestinian cause and the negative feelings towards Israel + Israelis that often accompany it — this performance feels very timely.         
         
A work about Raz's ethnicity + gender, racism, and the underlying fear that perpetuates it. Can we surmount divisions imposed by occupation? Can we go beyond the blame game and really see each other's all too vulnerable humanity?            
          
#### Who is she?             
Jerusalem-born singer-songwriter Avital Raz has made a name for herself, singing politically engaging, strikingly original and fearless songs, to emerge as a distinctive and truly individual voice that speaks with a very real and potent self-expression.       
            
Avital studied at The School of Visual Theatre in Jerusalem, before embarking on a 20 year career as a singer/songwriter and musician. She has released seven albums of her own music; and has been performing with Rafiki Jazz for three years.        
        
#### What people have said about her        
>*Funny at times, always feisty and possibly even a bit bonkers. It is likely to be one of the most compelling things you hear all year.* — The Herald Scotland
