#### In Brief        
*"Young, gay, fabulous – it's all about being out and going out… isn't it?"*         
        
Fuelled by internalised homophobia and beset by social anxiety, Mark agonises over the 'correct' way to be a 'good gay', to be himself, and to connect with others. All he wants to do is invite you out… for a good night in.

#### More              
An exploration of the social pressures impacting young gay men, *Staying In* examines identity, anxiety and internalised homophobia through psychology, physical theatre and a good dose of absurdity. How can we connect when words fail us – can performance be the answer?       
          
#### Who is he?             
Made in Manchester, Mark Croasdale is a theatre maker and performance artist, interested in human psychology, human history and the humour of being human. Mark's practice seeks to fuse different art forms — making unique experiences which surprise, delight and perhaps unnerve audiences. His work includes immersive audio installations (*Anonymous*, Sydney, 2014), theatre (*Blink*, Salford, 2015), and site-specific pop-ups (*Letters From Egypt*, The National Trust, 2017).
