### Artists in Alphabetical Order (*subject to change*)      
***Please note this is primarily an adult event, see Access Info below.***        
           
**Amy Steel | *Lifeline***        
The performance *Lifeline* hovers in a liminal space, caught between private and public. A domestic object is suspended before a moving body, out of which a threshold appears; a doorway into a new being.         
         
Amy graduated from Goldsmiths University with a BA in Fine Art in 2015. Her work has been included in shows at Arcadia Misa Gallery, London; Fat Relic, London; White Conduit Projects, London. In 2017 her work will be shown at the Centre for Contemporary Art, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

**Dominique Baron-Bonarjee | *Sui Generis***        
*Sui Generis: 'In a class of its own, not like anything else, unique'.*         
In our societies the needs of the individual for freedom, expression and fulfilment have to coexist with the need to belong to a group, to make ourselves recognisable to others by showing signs of this group through nationality, subcultures, religions and even gender. Groups become a 'territory' or home, a frame of recognition and protection. Featuring three monolithic costumes, *Sui Generis* develops a cycle of form and formlessness, which explores the creation of self and identity and interrogates the human form as a space for the inscription of categories, territories and realities.         
         
Dominique is a French-Indian artist, based between Berlin and London. The primacy of the body as a framework for observing the social, personal and invisible realms of being, recurs within her work. She is a graduate of St Martin's School of Art, London. Selected 2016 exhibitions and performances: *Vacancies*, Galerie Wedding, Berlin; *Loitering with Intent*, People's History Museum, Manchester; *Collapse* at [Hazard 2016](/archive/2016-hazard), Manchester; *Sui Generis* at Water Tower Arts Festival, Sofia (Bulgaria).

**Elena Molinaro | *CUT OFF***         
A durational performance dealing with notions of displacement and remoteness, urgency and resistance to the recent political events that have put Europe and its people in a state of total uncertainty.          
         
Elena is a performance maker based in London. Since 2010 she has developed a rigorous body-based practice at the interface between live art and performance. For over ten years she has also been working as a performance artist teaching and performing for different artistic directors, and in various educational and community settings. Her work has been seen both nationally and internationally in venues such as The NoN Festival of Contemporary Art, Trento, Italy (2015), City of Women Performance Festival, Ljubljana (2015), Dance Base, Edinburgh (2013); the National Theatre Studio, SPILL 2013.

**Jamil E-R Keating | *Asteroid RK1***          
An allegorical installation-performance about outer-space and our inner-city streets. Asteroids and addictions. Meteorites and human rights. Comets in the night sky and care in the city.         
Developed as a Divergency micro-commission with support from [hÅb](/hab) + <a href="http://stunlive.com" target="_blank">STUN</a> (Sustained Theatre Up North).       
         
Jamil is an emerging theatre-maker, writer and performer. *Asteroid RK1* is his fourth piece of work, the fourth step in an artistic journey of trying to find the balance between being overwhelmed by a perverse enthusiasm for the absurdity of life, and trying to say something of substance about it… simply.         
To date: he has made small pieces for Hazard (as Tracey Lumpkin) and Emergency; received a [Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead/keating) commission from hÅb + Contact; collaborated as dramaturg on a performance at The Royal Exchange; assistant directed for Contact; curated performances at Manchester Art Gallery; been an emerging artist in residence at the Whitworth.        
         
**Jen Morgan | *Get In My Bed***         
A one-to-one experience, in which I invite you to get in my bed. Telling you the story of the breakdown of my marriage. I journey you through the story with position movements and a distancing of contact. A piece of solo autobiographical work.          
         
Currently studying at UCLan, Jen's previous work *Breeze Block Pedestal* was seen at Eventure Arts' *Unknown Identity* at Nexus Cafe, Manchester.                 
             
**Matthew Harrison-Lord | *(Mis)Information Desk***         
An improvised, site-specific live art performance that provides correct, misleading, and irrelevant information. Overly long directions, news about the weather, random facts about the invention of the wheel, and hot gossip about Katie Price's latest wedding. A parodic performance providing playful opportunities for misinformation and subject redefinition.        
"a spectacle of the absurd" — Art in Liverpool | 2016

**Maya Chowdhry | *Peas on Earth***         
The domestication of the pea took place 11,000 years ago in the Near East. Which East is near depends on whether you called the wind trade-winds or hava. Using the humble pea as a symbol of our relationship to food, a portion of poetry and a pair of gardening gloves, *Peas on Earth* is a table-top of interactive theatre that gently augments our reality to allow us to experience the politics of eating, growing and sustaining ourselves.          
*Age advisory: 14+ (parental/guardian discretion).*

**Peter Jacobs | *No Man Is An Island***         
A durational performance installation that explores perceptions of public, personal and private space, freedom and restriction through gameplay and movement within a series of fixed spaces. A group of men in a performance area of ever-decreasing size, with a random and unknown hierarchy that turns on its head as those with the most space become those trying to fit into a space where there is none left.         
         
Peter is an experienced performer currently exploring new opportunities within performance making. Having performed in many different artists' projects as a volunteer, in 2014 he started to devise his own concepts. His interests lie in exploring ideas of ordinariness and the unthinking choreography of unconsidered everyday life. He is also interested in dystopian worlds, censorship, ageing, masculinity and male sexual identity.

**Roxanne Carney | *TwentyOne OhOne Thirteen***        
Roxanne has had a miserable break-up. Just like everybody else. But hers is totally different — trust her. Confused about how to move on, Roxanne turns to well known love songs to seek advice in this intimate and raw performance. This one-on-one is an exploration of pop culture, the stigma of women within break-ups and self-help.        
         
Roxanne is an artist and a producer. As an interdisciplinary artist, her work reflects on being a feminist and activist. She has performed at Camden People's Theatre's *Calm Down Dear* and Battersea Arts Centre's *Freshly Scratched*. Alongside her performance experience, she has worked with institutes such as The Marlborough Theatre + Forest Fringe, and artists Victoria Melody + Jamal Harewood amongst others.
