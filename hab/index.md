### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer, and strategic advocate of contemporary performance, live art, and sited work in the North of England. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy — working in collaboration with a range of [partners](/hab/partners) to produce showing [opportunities](/hab/opportunities), platforms, and artist development projects including: [Divergency](/hab/divergencymcr), [Domestic](/hab/domestic), [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), and [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).         
          
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with [artists, colleagues, venues + others](/hab/partners) to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish, and is:<br>• supported using public funding by <a href="http://artscouncil.org.uk/our-investment/national-portfolio-2018-22" target="_blank">Arts Council England</a>;<br>• a core <a href="http://divergencymcr.org" target="_blank">Divergency</a> partner alongside STUN — encouraging diversity in live art;<br>• a <a href="http://gm-artisthub.co.uk" target="_blank">GM Artist Hub</a> partner — a joint artist development project from thirteen organisations across Greater Manchester;<br>• a GM LGBTQ+ Arts & Culture Network member;<br>• a GM Independent Artist Initiative supporting partner, and;<br>• a <a href="http://liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a> member — a national network supporting + developing the UK's Live Art infrastructure for the benefit of artists, presenters + audiences.         
        
Since Jan 2012, hÅb has been 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/) — a peripatetic programme of, and online signpost to, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond… *NB: this part of our site aims to offer information to* **artists** *wishing to know more about hÅb's work and how to get involved; for more information about our public-facing programme please see [Word of Warning](/).*       
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), our annual micro-festival for new live work presenting around 30 short works in a day every autumn and it's recent iteration [StopGap](/hab/emergency); through to [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work with Contact — we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance + live art.           
         
In 2020 we began a series of "[Domestic](/hab/domestic) at homes" — an informal online platform for artists to beta test new ideas, live from their homes — our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call seeks proposals</a> for performance works that can be presented online, within an artist's available resources. Alongside live works, artists propose pre-recorded pieces that don't fit this format — so in December 2020 we introduced <a href="http://domesticatedonline.org" target="_blank">Domesticated</a>, a new home for video performance, currently featuring eight works.          
          
hÅb curates sited performance and interventions — presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention that takes performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre; as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our frequent foray into all ages live art with Z-arts. We also co-produce [Turn](/hab/turn) with Contact, a regular micro-festival for new northern dance + dance-makers (*currently on hiatus*).           
         
In any given year, hÅb might work with 150 artists, present a couple of platforms, a sited festival, and present over 60 pieces of work as [Word of Warning](/).
