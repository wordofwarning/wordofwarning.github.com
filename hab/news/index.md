### Upcoming Symposium: Friday 20 July 2018, 12.30pm-7pm        
        
***<a href="www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/kidnap20-the-art-of-incarceration-tickets-45734469028Eventbrite" target="_blank">KIDNAP@20: The Art of Incarceration Symposium</a>*<br>Martin Harris Centre, University of Manchester | Free**          
        
Widely covered in the press and media, *KIDNAP* caught the public imagination as an edgy example of what the internet was now making possible. A pivotal event in Blast Theory's evolution as a company, the piece also anticipated all kinds of subsequent developments in the wider culture — from the round-the-clock surveillance of reality TV shows like Big Brother, to the 21st century vogue for audience participation in live art, and the contemporary ubiquity of 'escape rooms' (getting yourself locked up for kicks).        
        
*KIDNAP@20* is a one-day symposium marking the piece's 20th anniversary, which will look back at where we were then, and ask where we are now. What has changed in the realms of digital art and technology, participatory performance, and the politics of consent? When, how and why do surveillance, imprisonment, and power games become art or entertainment?          
        
The event includes a screening of the film document of *KIDNAP* (30 mins) and reflections on other relevant work, including Rideout's *Cell Project* (2016) and Ali Matthews' *What the Money Meant* (2014). Full schedule tba.        
        
Participants include:        
Matt Adams, Ju Row Farr and Nick Tandavanitj (Blast Theory core artists) | John McGrath (Artistic Director, Manchester International Festival; author of Loving Big Brother) | Saul Hewish (Artistic Director, Rideout: Creative Arts for Rehabilitation) | Ali Matthews (independent artist; University of Salford) | Tamsin Drury (hÅb) + Dave Carter (University of Manchester) | Matt Fenton (Artistic Director, Contact) | Petra Tauscher (Dramaturg and Producer, HOME Manchester) | Professor Stephen Coleman (University of Leeds) | Russell Ward (1998 Kidnap victim)
