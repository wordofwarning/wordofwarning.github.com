##Ira Brand    
####More    
*A Cure for Ageing* is a piece about being young and foolish, and becoming old and wise. Or about being young and wise, and becoming old and foolish. It asks how we can talk more honestly about ageing, drawing together true personal accounts and shameless speculation in a celebration of life and an attempt to fall in love with our own decline. A show of indelicate questions and immortal jellyfish, we consider numbers, years, the passing of time, and the fact that we have all, already, started dying.        
        
*I’m sorry to do this so early in the show. It’s really quite rude of me. But do you mind if I ask you how old you are?*       
        
####Who is she?    
Ira is an artist, performance-maker and writer, working across theatre and live art. Her practice is rooted in the experience of being human, rather than singular narratives, and aims to make an audience re-consider themselves, and the world within which they live, through work that is evocative and intimate.              
*A Cure for Ageing* is Ira’s second full-length solo performance. Her first solo show, *Keine Angst*, toured the UK in 2011-12. Her work has been presented at Camden People’s Theatre, The Junction, The ShowRoom, PULSE Festival, Buzzcut Festival, Forest Fringe, Norwich Arts Centre, and *A Cure for Ageing* was part of the SPILL Festival National Platform in 2012.             
Ira's work often draws on autobiography, and research in the form of found images or objects, scientific, biographical, and factual sources. She likes talking to an audience, and her work increasingly includes elements of participation. Ira primarily makes live performance, and her work strives to be visceral, exciting, funny and tender. She is committed to making work that uses experimental modes of performance but remains humorous, playful and accessible to a wide audience.               
Ira was a founding member of collaborative performance groups Tinned Fingers and Antique Women. She regularly also works in collaboration with other companies and artists, which currently include Made In China and Andy Field.             
               
####What people have said about her    
>*Brand is passionate, knowledgeable, inquisitive and tender in her approach to the audience and the
subject matter… Through an hour that passes by all too quickly, Brand explores how it feels to
become old, the effects of ageing on our bodies and minds, and the impact our own ageing has on
those close to us. This is not a show one would describe as pleasant or entertaining. It's powerful,
uncomfortable, and beautiful… Her methods are unashamedly unscientific yet the work carries an
authority born out of absolute honesty.*<br>Fringe Review, Highly Recommended Show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2013    
>*At times gut wrenchingly honest, and at others quite humorously direct, this piece opened more
questions than it answered…. Just what theatre should be; with an engaging aesthetic, a weaving
narrative of the author's own, and at least one thought to take way and chew over.*<br>Audience member, London
