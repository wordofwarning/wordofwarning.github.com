A battle for political domination fought with wit, cunning and stoic determination. 

Heraldic symbols of England and Scotland, the Lion and the Unicorn embody the auld enemies, squaring up for the final struggle for independence.      

*Choose your side, stand and fight, back the winner and make sure that, what ever happens, you stand your ground.*
