*Presented by* Word of Warning, Contact + STUN *in* [Works Ahead 2019](/current/2019-worksahead) *as a double bill with* [Avital Raz](/current/2019-worksahead/raz)               
         
#### In Brief        
*"Young, gay, fabulous — it's all about being out and going out… isn't it?"*         
        
Fuelled by internalised homophobia and beset by social anxiety, Mark agonises over the 'correct' way to be a 'good gay', to be himself, and to connect with others. All he wants to do is invite you out… for a good night in.

#### More              
Exploring the social pressures impacting young gay men, *Staying In* examines identity, anxiety and internalised homophobia through psychology, physical theatre and a good dose of absurdity.        
        
How can we connect when words fail us? Can performance be the answer?       
          
#### Who is he?             
Made in Manchester, Mark Croasdale is a theatre maker and performance artist interested in human psychology, human history and the humour of being human.         
        
Mark's practice seeks to fuse different art forms — making unique experiences which surprise, delight and perhaps unnerve audiences. His work includes immersive audio installations (*Anonymous*, Sydney, 2014), theatre (*Blink*, Salford, 2015), and site-specific pop-ups (*Letters From Egypt*, The National Trust, 2017).
