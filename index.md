#### There's a mini-outbreak of [Hazardous](/current/2018-springsummer/hazardshadowgirl/) behaviour on the streets of Manchester, *Sat 4 Aug*. Meanwhile, discover new northern performance in our <a href="http://wordofwarning.posthaven.com" target="_blank">Weekly Warning</a>; we're also seeking artists for [Emergency](/hab/emergency), our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance.            
<hr>               
#### We'd like to find out more about our audiences — WHO you are, WHY you come to our events, WHAT you think of us… If you came to see [Emma + Vijay](/current/2018-worksahead) during Works Ahead or saw [Deborah](/current/2018-springsummer/pearson) at The Lowry and would like to give us feedback, please go to our <a href="http://research.audiencesurveys.org/s.asp?k=152950990710" target="_blank">online survey</a>. *Thanks!*
