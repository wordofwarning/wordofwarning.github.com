**Turn 2016**, our eighth annual platform for North West dancers + dance-makers, is calling for proposals. Taking place on **Friday 22 + Saturday 23 April 2016** at Manchester's Contact, Turn 2016 is a hÅb, Contact, Dance Manchester co-production.    
  
North West* dancers and dance-makers (aged 18+) are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this annual event. To get a feel for it, have a look at the [2015 programme](/archive/2015-turn) + [gallery](/galleries/2015-turn).   
 
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 15 January 2016.**     
   
**Turn:**    
An open submission dance platform for North West* dancers + dance-makers:    
● short finished pieces;      
● excerpts;    
● works in progress;    
● sited works in and around the building also welcomed.    
Proposals should be for pieces with some live presence, 20 minutes maximum for show-type work, technically simple, adaptable to quick turnarounds and suitable for showing alongside other pieces.    
Sited and intervention-based works in and around the venue (Contact) are also strongly encouraged.    
We are also accepting proposals for video based work to be screened around the building.     
* *effectively Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire + Merseyside: **NOT** Yorkshire*    

**Turn:**      
● a public platform;    
● an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work;    
● an artist networking event;    
● a selection platform for the Turn Prize (a small, supported commission, supported by Dance Manchester, Contact + hÅb).      

We are looking for dance in any form which uses the artists' creativity, has strong concept, original choreography and professional aspiration. For example, alongside Contemporary, we'd be interested in hearing about street dancers who are looking to choreograph a piece rather than to present a demonstration of  skill; or classical work (from Ballet to Kathak, African and Chinese dance to Bharata Natyam) that is being re-imagined or re-explored, rather than a straight re-presentation of classic choreography.    
 
Priorities are for high quality and exciting dance based work by North West* artists, which has not been seen in Manchester before.    
 
**To apply:**     
1. Read the venue (Contact)'s [tech specs](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/contact-tech-specs) + [policies and procedures](http://turnmcr.posthaven.com/pages/policies-and-procedures-14138);    
2. Complete and submit the [proposal](https://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/turn-2016-proposal-form) + [monitoring](http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form) forms    
(Direct form links: https://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/turn-2016-proposal-form + http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form);    
3. Include a short (compulsory) video submission — upload to your own YouTube/Vimeo or similar page and include the link in the proposal form; alternatively send via [wetransfer.com](http://www.wetransfer.com) (or similar) to <mailto:turn@habarts.org> OR send a DVD to: hÅb, c/o Z-arts, 335 Stretford Road, Manchester, M15 5ZA. Video should be short (max 10 mins) and does not have to be high quality. It can be from a camcorder, digital camera or mobile phone. It really helps your proposal if you can show some of what you are proposing — rehearsal footage or a video sketch of ideas and style.        
N.B. We would appreciate it if everyone could use the online form, but if you have significant difficulties contact <mailto:turn@habarts.org> for an offline version.    
  
**Closing Deadline: 5pm, Friday 15 January 2016.**    
  
**Notes:**    
● The proposal form must be completed at one sitting (you can't save and return to it later) so please copy and paste the longer elements from another document.    
● Turn 2016 will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses for NW artists.    
● There will be a **technical meeting for ALL selected artists on Saturday 9 March 2016 (daytime)**.    
● Enquiries: <mailto:turn@habarts.org> | <http://turnmcr.org> | #TurnMcr    
        
Taking place at Contact on 22 + 23 April 2016, Turn 2016 is presented by Word of Warning + Contact; co-produced by hÅb, Contact + Dance Manchester; supported using public funding through Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council.
