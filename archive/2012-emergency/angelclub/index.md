The 'mirror twins' take the weight from your shoulders and transport you to exotic climes in this head to head encounter of canap√© art.    

*I find it hard to believe you don't know the beauty you are... but if you don't, let me be your eyes... a hand to your darkness, so you won't be afraid.* Velvet Underground - I'll Be Your Mirror lyrics
