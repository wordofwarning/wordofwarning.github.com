**Works Ahead** is a project developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes hÅb ran with greenroom until 2011. Since 2012 it has offered thirty-five small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the previous year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events; support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work, often in partnership with <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a>…

#### 2012         
The [first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah) was a new partnership at Contact in May/June (as a Re:Con co-production), featuring a night of performances from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol; and an evening of interactions from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
#### 2013                 
Our [second Works Ahead](/archive/2013-worksahead) took place in May at Contact, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 [Turn](/hab/turn) Prize*); and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre + Wayne Steven Jackson… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
#### 2014         
Our [third Works Ahead](/archive/2014-worksahead) took place in May at Contact, with a triple bill of work that delved into the mindset of the performer from Lindsay Bennett, Paul O'Donnell + SheepKnuckle… See [image gallery](/galleries/2014-woah).        
        
#### 2015         
Our [fourth Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead) took place in April at Contact, with a double bill from Nathan Birkinshaw + Jamil Keating: two young male artists questioning man-liness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era… See [image gallery](/galleries/2015-woah).          
           
#### 2016         
Our [fifth Works Ahead](/archive/2016-worksahead) took place in June at Contact, with two very different double bills from four artists at different stages in their careers: Terri Donovan + Afreena Islam; Top Joe + Lucy McCormick… See [image gallery](/galleries/2016-woah).             
          
#### 2017         
Our [sixth Works Ahead](/archive/2017-worksahead) took place in May, with two nights in two venues featuring three artists: Tom Cassani + Toni-Dee Paul's double bill at Contact, and Chanje Kunda in STUN Studio (at Z-arts)… See [image gallery](/galleries/2017-woah).                 
                 
#### 2018         
Our [seventh Works Ahead](/archive/2018-worksahead) took place in May at STUN Studio, with a double bill from Emma Geraghty + Vijay Patel: a girl and a guitar, a boy and a box of questions; two artists at the start of their journeys… See [image gallery](/galleries/2018-woah). In 2018 we also seed-commissioned Jamal Gerald's new work for development in partnership with Transform in Leeds; [*Idol*](/archive/2020-spring/gerald) was planned to show in March 2020 but cancelled due to Covid-19.            
              
#### 2019         
Our [eighth Works Ahead](/archive/2019-worksahead) took place in May at STUN Studio, with a double bill from Mark Croasdale + Avital Raz: two explorations of inner conflict, outer division, and the politics of oppression… See [image gallery](/galleries/2019-woah).          

#### 2020         
Our ninth Works Ahead was planned as a sited double bill from artists Will Dickie + Ross McCaffrey at NIAMOS in partnership with Contact: [Will](/archive/2020-spring/dickie) adapted his work for livestreaming, <a href="http://youtu.be/yrZFSzURaS4" target="_blank">broadcast in May</a>; Ross postponed sharing his work until it can be shown to a physical audience.         
            
#### 2021         
This year, commissions have been awarded to artists Helena Ascough + Jade Dominique Williams in partnership with Contact; during 2021 both artists will develop their ideas and we hope to present their works to a physical audience at Contact in 2022.
