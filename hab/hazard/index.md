**Hazard** is our biennial micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance, blurring the boundaries between art and activism… Over 80 artists have taken to the streets of Manchester including: Action Hero, Alex Bradley, Jordan Mackenzie, Juliann O’Malley, Katherina Radeva, Michael Pinchbeck, Richard DeDomenici, Shahram Entekhabi + the vacuum cleaner.         
            
Our **[sixth Hazard](/current/2016-hazard)** pops up in Manchester's <a href='http://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUP9hOfLluWs.kfWwdpVK74IU' target='_blank'>St Ann's Square</a> and surrounding streets on Saturday 9 July 2016, with the callout for artists beginning very soon. For a glimpse of previous outbreaks of hazardous behaviour see 2014's [programme](/archive/2014-hazard) + [image gallery](/galleries/2014-hazard).            
            
So far we've wrapped Cathedral Gardens in fluttering hazard tape, pitted together a lion and a unicorn, moved the goalposts (literally) and witnessed flat packed children take over the streets of Manchester — oh, and conducted a hoola-hoopathon; The Larks had the public riddling, racing and chasing as urban archaeologists and private investigators, injecting mass gaming into St Ann's Square and beyond.           
           
[Hazard 2016](/current/2016-hazard) is presented by Word of Warning; produced by [hÅb](/hab), in collaboration with the participating artists; supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council.
