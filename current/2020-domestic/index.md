#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For this new series of Domestic "at homes", we invited six artists to try out new works about what's on their minds — using whatever resources they have to hand…         
        
>*A chat on a hill above the city;<br>The highs and lows of romance in lockdown;<br>A DNA test, a dead bird, and a misjudged identity;<br>Wash your hands and business as usual;<br>When I think of home;<br>The space between us will not be televised.*           
          
Real lives, real stories, real homes.
