###Saturday 28 February 2015, 12noon-4pm. Free             
Haphazard 2013 filled this historic building to the brim with bizarre antics and amazing images — there were moving musical sculptures; a bouncy, squeaky, ping-pong dance; and an underground labyrinth (but only for the brave).                               
                       
Why not join us to see what offbeat oddities and intriguing images 2015 will conjure? Playful, quirky, fun and sometimes plain daft: this is a very different day for kids and their adults, and adults and their adults. Turn up at any time and come and go as you please.
