#### What people have said about previous Works Ahead        
>*A strong double bill tonight from @WarnMcr's ever-reliable #WorksAhead. Brave & nuanced theatre-making from @markcroasdale (Staying In) & @avitalraz (My Jerusalem). Looking forward to seeing how both shows develop.<br><a href="http://twitter.com/CirclesStalls/status/1129503777566937088" target="_blank">@CirclesStalls on 2019</a><br>*…evenings like Works Ahead are vital …both [pieces] harness techniques and raise ideas which are truly compelling.*<br><a href="http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/features/works-ahead-expect-something-weird-personal-entirely-half-done" target="_blank">The State of The Arts on 2018</a><br>*A cathartic, funny and brutally honest show about bodies, particles and the universe.*<br><a href="http://afronalysis.com/2017/05/14/review-superposition-stun" target="_blank">Afronalysis on 2017</a><br>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless …make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*<br><a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave on 2016</a><br>*Always an informal way to experience something a bit different.<br>*Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.*<br>*Great to see new work by younger artists.*<br>*Higher standard than I was expecting of a work in progress … both offered perspectives that I hadn't heard before.<br>— Audience Feedback
