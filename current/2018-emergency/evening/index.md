**AIDAN STRUDWICK | *A CHRISTMAS SHOW***         
A musical about money, exposure, and showmanship in the arts, dressed up as a loose adaptation of A Christmas Carol, a text that has been adapted and parodied countless times. AIDAN STRUDWICK is seen as a bizarre, misunderstood cult-figure, desperate for attention and, quite often, money, so wants to capitalise on this story.        
        
**AIDAN STRUDWICK.** Inspired by social media-induced millennial narcissism, AIDAN STRUDWICK has performed at Tate Modern, Royal Academy of Art, Hazard 2016, Camden Peoples Theatre, Artsadmin, The Palace (Nysa, Poland), and Pudderaum (Berlin).

**Avital Raz | *My Jerusalem***

**Two Blue Ticks | *On A Clear Morning in May***         
When something happens, not everyone experiences it first hand. In fact, most people don't. Some people see the aftermath. Some people speculate on why it happened. And some people react. Violently.        
Written and directed by Greg Saxton, *On A Clear Morning In May* is a response to the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017. Told through the voices of a Witness, an Expert and a Revolutionary, it explores how people respond when terror is brought to their doorstep.

**Tom Cassani | *I Promise You That Tonight***         
Turning water into wine. Turning waiting into accepting. Is a hard thing to do. Lying is done with words and also silence. Walking on water, spontaneous combustion, lightning and transubstantiation all have something in common.                    
See this. None of this is impossible. I promise you that tonight.
