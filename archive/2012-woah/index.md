#### Works Ahead 2012  
**A two night expoloration of the hidden world of Contact, in the company of a group of artists.  To see our gallery click [here](/galleries/2012-woah/index.html)**    

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-*'maze of performance'*: **emergency accommodation**. Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invited a group of the most intriguing **emergency accommodation** artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact.
