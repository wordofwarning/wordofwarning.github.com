####More            
Inspired by the extraordinary medical memoir written by Hungarian satirist Frigyes Karinthy, *A Journey Round My Skull* is a passionate love story which examines the complexity of the human brain by exploring the perplexing world of auditory hallucinations. Enveloping the audience in a fantastical sound-world, it playfully investigates what makes us who we are and the lengths we might go to in order to cure ourselves of our most painful and embarrassing memories.
