#### More         
*Shadow Girl* was a creative response to 2015 UK Government statistics showing that GMP recorded the UK's 2nd highest rate of hate crime — with the number of disablity motivated crimes more than doubling since 2014.           
              
*Shadow Girl* is about a girl that has become afraid of people and become a shadow of herself as result of the things people say about her. She can hear and understand the things that are said, and every time she hears hurtful words they chip away a little bit of her light.          
         
Sometimes it's more than words, and people are often fearful of making themselves visible or going outside.              
          
#### Who is she           
Chrissy Jones is a Manchester-based artist living with a Learning Disability Label – a long standing artist with Proud & Loud Arts currently working with The Lowry, DIY, and Access all Areas.          
              
*Shadow Girl* is her first solo work, originally developed as part of Proud & Loud Arts’ group work *Cells – A Body of Work*, here expanded and developed on a larger scale. In *Shadow Girl*, Chrissy wants to bring a positive discussion about learning disability to a wider public audience through a creative intervention in public spaces.             
             
#### Credits         
Supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.
