**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids + their adults, adults + *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!        
          
### Artists: save the date and get your thinking caps on!         
**Haphazard 2019 — *a free day out for the curious of all ages.*<br>Sat 27 Apr, 12noon-3pm at Z-arts. FREE**         
         
[hÅb](/hab)/[Word of Warning](/) + <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> are getting together again for the **fifth Haphazard**, taking place on Saturday 27 April 2019 in Manchester. There'll be a call for artist proposals later in January, but we know ‘all ages’ can be a challenge — so we want to give you a heads-up and some thinking time!          

This is not live art for children but live art for all ages — and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years — so work should have appeal for adults *and* children alike, even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!        
            
To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; a singing fish and a sax-playing bear; paintball golf and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet, and a tiny bee-shaped world… Get a feel for it with our [gallery of images](/galleries/2018-emergency) + [programme](/archive/2017-haphazard) from 2017, or delve further with a look at 2016's [images](/galleries/2016-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2016-haphazard), 2015's [images](/galleries/2015-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2015-haphazard), 2013's [images](/galleries//2013-haphazard) + [programme](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard).         
        
From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement, and nothing too text-heavy. We have access to a variety of spaces throughout the Z-arts building: a café, an atrium, some small spaces, some stairwells, and a big black box. Durational, intervention, and ‘come + go’ work seems to work the best — we're *not* really looking for sit-down theatre shows.
