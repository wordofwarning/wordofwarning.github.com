*Part of* Works Ahead 2016 Evening Edition: from Dyson to the Passion — an unpredictable double bill from Top Joe + Lucy McCormick.      
         
#### In Brief                      
Top Joe is a timid character who wears a hi-vis jacket and only comes out at night. He occasionally braves leaving the house in order to meet people and give his thoughts on life, vouchers and pistachios.<br>For Works Ahead he is developing a piece that explores the nature of Ross Kemp, Dyson vacuum cleaners, identity, comedy, and childhood.
