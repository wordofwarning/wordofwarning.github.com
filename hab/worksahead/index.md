**Works Ahead** is a project developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes hÅb ran with greenroom until 2011. Since 2012 it has offered over thirty small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the previous year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events; support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work…
