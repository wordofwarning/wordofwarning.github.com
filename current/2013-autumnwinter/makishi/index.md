####More       
Hawaiian performance-maker Stacy Makishi unearths another thrilling tale of filial-sleuthery; investigating midlife, mobs, meatballs and moms via Barbra Streisand, *E.T.* and *The Sopranos*.         
          
Masterfully grafting the trappings of gangster film onto domestic drama, *The Falsettos* is a humorous solo take on the mysteries of love, loss and separation.          
         
A loose sequel to [*The Making of Bull: The True Story*](/archive/2012-springsummer/makishi/index.html) (presented with Contact in March 2012), *The Falsettos* looks at the very idea of the sequel, asking how artists remain faithful to their personal style, sensibility and ‘vision’ without resorting to formulas, gimmicks, and expectations created by past works. How do artists respond to the maxim, 'Make it like the last one only make it better'?       
                              
####Who is she?    
Stacy Makishi is a transplant from Hawaii who found paradise in Dalston, East London in 1994.         
         
After graduating from the University of Hawaii she worked as a stand-up comic at the Comedy Store: but when her punchlines punched back, Stacy found herself happiest when making what New Yorkers called ‘Performance’.             
              
Her present body of work is interdisciplinary in scope and includes live art, film, installation and visual art. Her work is as complex as it is accessible; humorous as it is challenging; visual as it is literate.          
        
A workshop leader and mentor of international renown, Makishi opens her making processes to the public through workshops, open rehearsals and talks, alongside performances.           
  
She has been awarded an ICA Attached Artist Award, a Millennium Fellowship Award, a Live Art Development Agency One to One Bursary, an Artsadmin Bursary and the Franklin Furnace Award.        
She is an Associate Artist with Artsadmin, Chelsea Theatre and New Unity.          
           
####What people have said about her     
>*Stacy Makishi has a way of transforming the mundane into the radiant, where everyday people speak their innermost thoughts and where we as an audience experience truthful human moments that at times approach the surreal.*<br>Joshua Sofaer
