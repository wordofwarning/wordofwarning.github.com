#### What people have said about *Cock and Bull*         
>*Although Presley is the ghostly heart of it, it's neither an act of homage nor a simple nostalgia trip… by blurring the line between performers and their public, as well as the past and the present, Wohead creates a special bond.*<br><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/firstnightreviews/article4725184.ece" target="_blank">★★★★ Donald Hutera, The Times</a>        
>*He catches the swagger, the sex appeal, the smile. His attention is exacting – so concentrated and precise – and the process of transforming is transfixing: both electric and ghoulish. There's the air of a séance: a comeback special.*<br><a href="http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/comeback-special-shoreditch-town-hall_40045.html" target="_blank">Matt Trueman, Whatonstage</a>
