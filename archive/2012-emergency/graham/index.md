*You stand before a bed of earth. Perhaps it is empty, still, peaceful. Perhaps it is not.* 
            
Using a bed of earth, "the place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other", this piece explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.    

Kitty trained at Trinity Laban. During her time there she was lucky enough to perform in work by Reinhild Hoffman, Zoi Dimitriou, Matteo Fargion and Marie-Gabriell Rotie, whose Butoh practice has been a great inspiration for this piece.
