**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, showing around 30 short works over a day/evening in Manchester each autumn — the upcoming 21st edition takes place in its 7th home and is necessarily somewhat different…        
        
**[Emergency 2020](/current/2020-emergency)** will be a socially-distanced live walkthrough event on a date to be confirmed at the brand new <a href="http://contactmcr.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> — so new that this will be the first sneak preview audiences get! Small, booked audiences will be guided on a one-way journey through the building in timed slots with an *estimated* audience journey time of 75 minutes, pausing en route in gallery fashion.        
         
Our <a href="http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">**open call for proposals**</a> has now closed — we were looking for approximately 10 works to fit these conditions: durational, performance installation, looping + intervention-based live works that can run over a minimum period of 4 hours.      
        
*N.B. we realised this wouldn't be for everyone as the ask was constrained by the current circumstances — but we really think we should give it a damn good go! This event is now **to be confirmed** due to <a href="http://gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" target="_blank">new November restrictions</a> — further information to follow.*

**Emergency StopGap** was a new iteration for 2020 — a small informal platform to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter…         
         
Our [**inaugural StopGap**](/archive/2020-emergencystopgap) took place on **27 February 2020** in Manchester's <a href="http://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a> — an informal 'Thursday Late' style evening featuring 13 durational live works + interventions in and around the building — see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2020-emergencystopgap).
