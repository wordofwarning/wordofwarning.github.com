####Who are they?    
SheepKnuckle are James Monaghan + Padraig Confrey — who make work that manifests often itself as an experiment; who are interested in using interactive media and ‘the self’ to challenge and de-construct traditional dramaturgy. They met at Salford University in their first year and have been in love ever since.     
        
####Credits         
Commissioned by hÅb; co-produced by Contact.
