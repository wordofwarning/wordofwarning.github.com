This short summer extension to [Spring 2014](/archive/2014-spring) sees a triple-headed delve into performance psyches, a flash of international talent, and a hit-and-run incursion into the daily life of our city centre.    
                
Rounding off our spring sojourn at Contact in May is the third **[Works Ahead](/current/2014-worksahead)**, with a trio of new works-in-development from young artists [SheepKnuckle](/current/2014-worksahead/sheepknuckle), [Lindsay Bennett](/current/2014-worksahead/bennett) + [Paul O’Donnell](/current/2014-worksahead/odonnell). Through grand entrances and dramatic exits, constant approval seeking and extreme efforts to avoid the stage, Works Ahead delves into the mindset of the performer.     
   
In June we return to Z-arts for the second **[Flare Weekender](/current/2014-flare)** — two days of performance by new international theatre-makers from Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK, featuring guest perfomances of Leentje Van de Cruys's *Kitsch’n Sync* (last seen at [Domestic](/archive/2013-domestic/vandecruys)).       
      
Alongside resident gamers [The Larks](http://www.the-larks.com), in July, we embark on our fifth bid to take over Manchester's city centre with the ever-irreverent **[Hazard](/current/2014-hazard)** — look out for the tell-tale flashes of yellow and black, coming to a street near you!        
        
Really hoping to see you at some or all of it; if you want to check out what happened last season, have a look at our [Spring/Summer 2014 archive](/current/2014-springsummer).    
        
####What is Word of Warning and where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of live performance: an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester.

We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. In 2012, alongside funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Third Angel, Ellie Harrison, GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN, Levantes Dance Theatre, Action Hero, Richard DeDomenici, Made In China and many more, we served the audience gin and satsuma jello shots, played bingo, apple-bobbing, drenched them in confetti and reinvented St Andrews Day with snowballs and whisky macs.        
       
For 2013 we presented a whirlwind of work from artists including Lowri Evans, Hetain Patel, Michael Pinchbeck, the vacuum cleaner + Stacy Makishi, also creating a bonkers day of live art for all ages (Haphazard) and a performance festival for a 70s block of flats (Domestic).       

>*Curated by the ever-impressive Word Of Warning, Domestic consists of seven offbeat shows staged in a 1970s tower block in Hulme.*<br>[The Guardian's Lyn Gardner, on Domestic](http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/02/this-weeks-theatre)
        
####Who’s it for?
**Anyone looking for a different night out.**    

We don’t want to put you off by talking labels – yes there’ll be theatre, live art, dance – the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening – there’ll be something you might want to take a chance on.

####Who is Word of Warning?         
My name’s Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called **[hÅb](/hab)**, which was greenroom’s partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events – like **Emergency** (Manchester’s free marathon of live work with up to 40 shows over 3 venues) and **Hazard** (random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).

I’ve been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I’ve been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon Hallelujah chorus!    

On the less eccentric side over the years, hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at <mailto:info@habarts.org>             

I’m joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom’s long time programme coordinator. Often spotted in a hat or proffering a variety of bizarre refreshments, John is the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events.
