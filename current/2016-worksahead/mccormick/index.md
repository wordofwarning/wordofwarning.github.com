"I have cast myself as God in a large scale biblical re-enactment, performed via pop ballads and performance art with the help of two backing dancers. I was partly inspired to create this work by an ongoing interest in the Quaker belief in 'God' as one's own moral conscience — that of 'God in everyone'.<br>The piece is also an exercise in casting myself as the Ultimate Man, allowing for my interests and frustrations in gender politics and feminist discourse."

#### More
Post-popular prodigy Lucy McCormick and her Girl Squad present a trashstep-dubpunk morality play for the modern age. Casting herself in all the main roles, Lucy will attempt to re-connect to her own moral conscience by reenacting old biblical stories via a nu-wave holy trinity of dance, power ballads and performance art. With trademark absurdism and enthusiasm, Lucy puts her best foot forward in the face of existential deadlock. 

Lording it over western thought and stereotype, this show is a frenzied right of passage which is as enthusiastic as it is volatile.
