#### In Brief    
Jam sessions, patter with a Southern drawl, big dance numbers, and a bit of sweat: this is a re-enactment of Elvis Presley's *1968 Comeback Special*. Sort of.

#### More      
It's an experiment in time drag; wearing another time as drag and dragging another time into the present. What happens if the *Comeback* comes back? ***ADD?***
         
#### Who is he?     
Greg Wohead is a writer and performer who makes theatre shows, 1-to-1 performances and audio pieces… most recently for WoW in a [domestic setting](/archive/2013-domestic/wohead).      
         
***UPDATE*** Some of his work so far has been based around ideas of place and identity; he lived in Texas until moving to the UK at age 22, nearly 8 years ago. He likes work that’s personal and generous, and tries to make it with that in mind. He’s shown original work at places like Battersea Arts Centre, Ovalhouse, Wales Millennium Centre and The Yard, where he is an Artistic Associate.
