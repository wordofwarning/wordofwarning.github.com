####MICHAEL PINCHBECK - THE BEGINNING    
####More
*They are professionals.    
They have learned their lines.     
They are waiting to make their entrance.    
They are ready to begin.*    
 
Taking place somewhere between a rehearsal and a performance, dreaming and being awake, *The Beginning* asks how we might begin a career, a relationship, a life or a show. *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* meets the mesmerising music of Serge Gainsbourg in this tender love letter to theatre that addresses the unwritten contract between performers and an audience.    

Part theatrical memoir, part safety announcement, *The Beginning* is the second in a trilogy of work inspired by Shakespearean stage directions by the award-winning writer and performance maker Michael Pinchbeck. Because he has promised never to perform again, Michael has invited Nicki Hobday and Ollie Smith to help him to remember how it feels to perform for the first time.

####Who is he?    
Michael Pinchbeck is a writer, live artist and performance maker. He co-founded Metro-Boulot-Dodo in 1997 after studying Theatre and Creative Writing at Lancaster University. He left the company in 2004 to embark on a five-year live art project – *The Long and Winding Road*, performed at the ICA (London), Ikon Gallery (Birmingham) and the Bluecoat (Liverpool). Michael was commissioned by Nottingham Playhouse to write *The White Album* (2006) and *The Ashes* (2011) and was awarded a bursary by Theatre Writing Partnership to research a new play - *Bolero*.    

He is currently working on a trilogy of devised performances inspired by Shakespearean stage directions: *The Beginning*, *The Middle* and *The End*. In 2008, Michael was selected by Arts Council England to represent the UK at the Biennale for Young Artists in Italy. In 2012, he will be an ambassador for the World Event of Young Artists in Nottingham. His work has been selected twice for the British Council’s Edinburgh Showcase. He has a Masters in Performance and Live Art from Nottingham Trent University and is currently undertaking a PhD at Loughborough University exploring the role of the dramaturg in contemporary performance. Michael is a co-director of Hatch, a platform for performance in the East Midlands.

####MICHAEL PINCHBECK + THE DEBUTANTS - DEBUT    
#### More    
Contemporary Theatre Practice students from the University of Salford have worked with live artist and writer, Michael Pinchbeck, to device a piece that reflects on their own experiences of walking onstage for the first time. They may have been nervous. They may have forgotten their lines. They may have missed their entrance. These stories are a starting point for a show that looks at beginnings through the lens of what it means to perform. Debut asks what we do when we walk onstage and why we walk onstage in the first place.
