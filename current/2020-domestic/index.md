#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so [July](/current/2020-domestic/july) + [August](/current/2020-domestic/august) began a series of "Domestic at homes", with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.        
        
Join us on 7 October for our third set of "artists at home" — selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for proposals</a>. Real lives, real stories, real homes.
