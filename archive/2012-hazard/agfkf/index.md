Part performance, part demonstration. *Nothing Like This To Increase The Adrenaline Rush of the Crowd* challenges the role of the consumer in modern day society. The audience encounters the display in the same way shoppers gather around a promotional trolley in a shopping mall. Gale-Feeny and Fishman ask the public to question what they are being sold and why they are being seduced.     

Alice Gale-Feeny and Katherine Fishman obtained their Fine Art degrees at Nottingham Trent University. Most recently they curated an exhibition examining how language, speech-delivery and gesture alter between the media of performance and video.
