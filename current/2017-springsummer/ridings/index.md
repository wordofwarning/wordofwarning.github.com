#### More         
"I'm trying to understand why British women fall in love with men on death row. I'm corresponding with Jonny, incarcerated in Texas. I'm trying to understand the death penalty and how that fits into our 21st century world. I'm trying not to be judgemental."        
        
*The Road to Huntsville* is an exploration into unconventional love, state homicide and challenging preconceptions.              
        
"The idea came about after watching a documentary about death row, which featured pen pals who become friends and potentially wives. I found it difficult – firstly to come to terms with how those men and women live their lives knowing the state will put them to death. I couldn't begin to contemplate how it must feel to count the days you have left on this earth, stomach your last meal, and have the warden tell you, 'it's time', before walking to the gurney where you will breathe your last breath. And secondly – who are the people who seek out love with those who have committed such terrible crimes that the state sees the only fitting punishment is death?        
        
"Texas executes the most prisoners and has some of the harshest conditions. Death row, where the inmates are housed, is in Livingston, whereas the death chamber is 45 miles away in Huntsville, a small city with a population of just under 40,000, 25% of which are behind bars. The prison, nicknamed the 'Walls' Unit, is the oldest state prison in Texas and is also home to the USA's busiest execution chamber.        
        
"I don't want you to think for a minute I underestimate the crimes that lead the inmates to death row or the victims and their families they devastate with their actions. I am more than aware this is a very emotive subject area, one which many people have very strong opinions about. While the death penalty in the UK was abolished in 1964 the subject of capital punishment continues to be important, with the British Government committed to campaigning against the death penalty internationally. Ongoing discussion on the state's right to commit murder is one of fundamental human rights, and has resonance and relevance to audiences in countries with and without the death penalty."

#### What people have said about *The Road…*         
>*An inspired, deeply political essay rounded off by heartfelt empathy.*<br><a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720700401872412673" target="_blank">Alex Ballinger</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720680046999023616" target="_blank">Oxfordshire Guardian</a>          
>*…a bombastic, dynamic explanation of world affairs since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013.<br>I think that we're all broadly aware of the vast level of surveillance that the government subjects us to. The strength of AMtSB, however, is that their humour and simple, compelling performance presents the facts plainly and directly challenges any sense that this is something that we can simply ignore, or pretend does not apply to 'people like us'.*<br><a href="http://scan.lusu.co.uk/index.php/2016/02/09/review-proto-type-theatre-a-machine-theyre-secretly" target="_blank">Student Comment And News</a>, Lancaster University
