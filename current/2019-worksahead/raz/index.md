#### In Brief        
A nuanced exploration of the politics of division, from internal checkpoints and separation walls to gender norms. Can we go beyond the blame game to really see each other? Surmount divisions imposed by occupation?

#### More

#### Who is she?             
Jerusalem-born singer-songwriter Avital Raz has made a name for herself, singing politically engaging, strikingly original and fearless songs. In her first theatre piece, she intertwines songs with stories from her childhood in Israel. Emerging as a distinctive and truly individual voice that speaks with a very real and potent self-expression.         
***Do we need extra biography?***        
"*Funny at times, always feisty and possibly even a bit bonkers*" — The Scotland Herald has said of her music — "*It is likely to be one of the most compelling things you hear all year.*"          
***Does this work here, or how do we get it into the next section?***
