**Works Ahead** is a project developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes hÅb ran with greenroom until 2011. Since 2012 it has offered thirty-five small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the previous year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events; support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work, often in partnership with Contact…

The **[first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah)** took place in May/June 2012, with a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production) featuring a night of performances from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol; and an evening of interactions from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
Our **[second Works Ahead](/archive/2013-worksahead)** took place in May 2013 at Contact, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 [Turn](/hab/turn) Prize*); and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre + Wayne Steven Jackson… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
Our **[third Works Ahead](/archive/2014-worksahead)** took place in May 2014 at Contact, with a triple bill of work that delved into the mindset of the performer from Lindsay Bennett, Paul O'Donnell + SheepKnuckle… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2014-woah).        
        
Our **[fourth Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead)** took place in April 2015 at Contact, with a double bill from Nathan Birkinshaw + Jamil Keating: two young male artists questioning manliness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2015-woah).          
           
Our **[fifth Works Ahead](/archive/2016-worksahead)** took place in June 2016 at Contact, with two very different double bills from four artists at different stages in their careers: Terri Donovan + Afreena Islam; Top Joe + Lucy McCormick… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2016-woah).

In 2018 we also seed-commissioned Jamal Gerald's new work for development in partnership with Transform in Leeds; [*Idol*](/archive/2020-spring/gerald) was planned to show in March 2020 but cancelled due to Covid-19.
