####Order of Appearance (subject to change)      
**Drunken Chorus (UK) | *Just Like Larry Walters ***        
*In 1982, Larry Walters tied 45 helium balloons to his garden chair, and flew up into the sky. We want you to imagine that. We want you to close your eyes and hold on tight, as you drift up… over the city… over deserts… over jungles… over mountains…*        
               
Through tales of human endeavour, dance routines, and songs from *The Greatest Ever Party Album*, Drunken Chorus try to piece together something magical; only to find themselves surrounded by half-inflated party balloons, scraps of rubber and burst bubbles.             
                
Drunken Chorus are a London-based performance company, co-directed by Chris Williams and Sheena Holliday, creating challenging yet accessible work. Their shows are often messy and complicated — inspired by, amongst other things, stand-up comedy, horror movies and human endeavour. They also support early career artists through the DRUNKEN NIGHTS programme, as well as working with community groups.                
              
Creative Consultant: Cathy Naden | Composer: John Avery | Choreography: Lydia Cottrell | Supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England. Developed at Battersea Arts Centre and Junction, with support from Hatch.
