**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into all ages live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org)' building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!
        
In [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard) we filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!) — [2015](/archive/2015-spring/haphazard) saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!); to get a feel for it have a look at images from [2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard) + [2015](galleries/2015-haphazard).
        
Our **third Haphazard** takes over Z-arts on Saturday 20 February 2016 (turn up at any time 12noon to 4pm, come and go as you please) and we now seek proposals from artists: to apply, please complete online <a href="http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/haphazard-2016-proposal-form" target="_blank">application</a> + <a href="http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form" target="_blank">monitoring</a> forms.          
         
Haphazard 2016 is presented by Word of Warning + Z-arts; produced by hÅb; supported using public funding by Arts Council England, funded by Manchester City Council + supported by Z-arts.
