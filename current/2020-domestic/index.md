#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For our [pilot "Domestic at home"](/current/2020-domestic/july), we invited six artists to try out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.        
        
Join us on 7 October for our third set of "artists at home" — selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for proposals</a>. Real lives, real stories, real homes.        
         
[Domestic](/hab/domestic) (October 2020) hosted by Peader Kirk + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
