#### More         
Having never even been for a jog around the park, Lauren signed up to compete in the Tetra-Decathlon World Championships; committing to learn 14 different athletic events and then compete on the World stage, all in just 600 days.          
        
A funny and inspiring show exploring the hurdles on the way to the starting line, *Tetra-Decathlon* mixes humorous storytelling with athletic physicality as Lauren runs, jumps, and throws herself into a world of serious amateurs and comedic coaches — where winning is not simply about crossing the line first.       
         
***Following the show, audience members are invited to ask questions about the show and Lauren's experiences of training and competing in the Tetra-Decathlon.***
