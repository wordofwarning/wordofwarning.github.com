**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, each autumn showing at least 20 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester…           
         
Our [**twentieth Emergency**](/current/2019-emergency) took place on **Saturday 21 September 2019** with 34 live works taking over two sites in Manchester's Hulme: <a href="https://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a> during the daytime, and <a href="http://stunlive.com" target="_blank">STUN Studio</a> + <a href="http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> in the evening — now that it's over, see our [gallery of images](/galleries/2019-emergency).
