####In Brief

Blue is burying your head in the sand, it's drowning in whiskey and it's compiling a list of all the things you haven't yet done.     

####Who is she?

Krissi Musiol is the last person to leave the party (but not necessarily the last one standing).

![Krissi Musiol](w9krissi.jpg)

Krissi Musiol cannot dance - she can't waltz, can't salsa, she can't do a pirouette.  She can't do the twist, the tango, a tap dance, the tarantella.  She's can't two-step, hand-jive, boogie woogie, break dance, dirty dance, maypole dance.  She can't moonwalk.  No ballet, polka, flamenco, fandango, vogue or rumba.  Nor Irish dancing, Latin dancing, Polish dancing, no pole dancing.  There is no way her legs can do a Can-Can. 

####What people have said about her

>The way its language, movement, visuals and content were integrated created something simultaneously richly-layered and spare, intensely plausible yet built on a single family’s histories and myths.  From the moment when Musiol first appears on the white stage in a bridal gown, “a girl in a rotten grey dress searching for a rotten grey man”, the blend of truth and fiction, folklore and history, is seamlessly achieved. - *Audience member, Hatch, NEAT 11*

####More

>The girl has thoughts about ending her own life on more than one occasion.  She has thought about what it would be like to no longer exist. <br> She's going to shed her rotten wedding dress, count the days down backwards to try and go back in time to when she saw you last, back to the party, back to the bar.<br><em>There's so many things she learned but never used.</em><br>Things she didn't understand and things which only happened in her imagination.<br>Things that moved when no words were spoken.<br>Things written on huge walls in tiny letters.<br>Things that were written down in lists that no one ever read.<br>Things she's most afraid of and things she's not supposed to do.<br>She has created a strategy for survival because she thinks she might be dying...<br>She's thinking about dying and also turning 30. And somewhere in between there, there's a broken love story.

####Works Ahead: Performances

Three artists, three performances, three takes on singledom, absence and the onset of the thirties. An emerging programme full of surprises and an insight into performance that defies definition. 

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-*'maze of performance'*: [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/). Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing *emergency accommodation* artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
