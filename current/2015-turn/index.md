###Friday 27 + Saturday 28 March 2015, 7.30pm
Pirouetting and spinning, twizzling and twirling, Turn lands at Contact for its fourth year… this two-day conflagration of the best new dance in town explodes into life, with some fifteen new works taking over the whole building.           
                  
Fluidly lyrical, effervescently acrobatic or eccentrically innovative, Turn has played host to curly haired capoeira twins, a ballerina in a body bag and a goggle-wearing, flipper-dance — join us in 2015 for another round of physical exuberance.               
                  
Turn 2015 is our seventh annual platform for dancers + dance-makers — to get a feel for it, see Turn 2014's [programme](/archive/2014-turn) + [image gallery](/galleries/2014-turn).
