####More            
Rachel Mars has always relied on humour. In her latest solo performance, she goes in search of what is beyond the gags.                 
           
Turning the spotlight on the inner workings of comedy, *The Way You Tell Them* interrogates the desire and – sometimes uncontrollable – compulsion to be funny. What are we scared of? Where does the responsibility lie when going for a laugh?             
            
Using real-life material, classic oral sex jokes and a wolf suit, Rachel weaves a thoughtful and provocative story that questions how we use and abuse humour. Directed by Fringe First Winner Jamie Wood, this very funny and beautifully sad show arrives from sold-out performances in Brighton, London + Edinburgh.
