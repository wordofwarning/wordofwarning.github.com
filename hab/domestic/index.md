In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented **Domestic** works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
              
**Summer 2020's series of Domestic "at homes"** invites artists to try out new works about what's on their minds — using whatever resources they have to hand…

#### *Domestic origins…*         
         
**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes… See the [image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).         
         
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/archive/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on a new block of flats, this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment — Matthias Court (M3 6JD) was a space in transition — using only the top (15th) + ground floors over 3 nights + a day to show 17 pieces by artists including Leo Burtin, Ria Hartley, Catherine Hoffman, Cheryl Martin, Michael Pinchbeck + Louise Wallwein… See a rapid overview <a href="http://vimeo.com/143630694" target="_blank">on vimeo</a> + the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic).        
        
**In November 2017, [*Rent Party: Domestic Edition*](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard)** popped up next door in Salford's Adelphi Court during its refurb… Part show, part party, Darren Pritchard Dance's joyously defiant stand against growing up poor is a 21st century, austerity Britain, black, gay, immersive musical — for those just about managing. See the [image gallery](/galleries/2017-domestic). Thanks to our generous audiences we donated £574.65 & four crates of food to Salford Foodbank.        
        
Domestic (Summer 2020) is presented by [Word of Warning](/) + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
