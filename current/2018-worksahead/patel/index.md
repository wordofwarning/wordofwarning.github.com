#### More              
At the turn of the millennium, Vijay was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). In a time where the diagnosis was new, he went through courses of prescribed drugs in order for him to cope in the 'real' world. Almost 20 years later, he's decided to make a show about it…        
        
*Sometimes I Leave* is a performance, a respite, which navigates the point within a conversation context when it all gets too much. How do we leave this context? Why do we leave this context? And maybe there are more inner anxieties about the thought of leaving than actually doing it. He's often been accused of saying the wrong thing, looking at people the wrong way, and navigating his Asperger's mind as an adult.         
        
#### Who is he?             
A London-based performance artist, Vijay Patel crosses forms from live art, performance, cabaret, and installation. The work he makes predominantly surrounds cultural identity, making political points about this within the contemporary condition. His earlier performances have previously dealt with the complexities of being of mixed Indian/British heritage, gender, sexuality, and the crossover between these subjects. Vijay is currently interested in exploring his Asperger's identity, further research on disability studies, and how he can communicate this to a wider audience.        
          
#### What people have said about him         
>*An engaging, exciting and charming performance artist. His work is funny, poignant, fearlessly personal, and current. He makes the political palatable and uses pop-culture references to inform his work and turn them on their head in a surprising and entertaining way.*<br>— Sh!t Theatre<br>*Vijay Patel is a dynamic young artist exploring the contemporary condition with humour, pathos and heart. Mark him as one to watch.*<br>— Simon Casson, Duckie
