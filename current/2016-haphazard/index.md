####More    
[Haphazard 2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard) filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!) — [2015](/archive/2015-spring/haphazard) saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!) — why not join us to see what 2016 will conjure? To get a feel for it have a look at images from [2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard) + [2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard).
