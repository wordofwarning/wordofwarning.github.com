*A free afternoon of incidental intervention and sited performance in Mcr City Centre, presented by Word of Warning on Saturday 9 July: turn up at any time from 12 noon to 5pm and discover activity around <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUP9hOfLluWs.kfWwdpVK74IU" target="_blank">St Ann's Square</a>…*            
         
**There There | *Text HOME***          
*Text HOME to 78070* is a durational performative invasion of immigration advice. It sees two stereotypical Eastern Europeans occupy public spaces to distribute first-hand tips on everything from getting a work permit to navigating the NHS, helping immigrants integrate and endanger the British way.         
          
*Text HOME to 78070* is the brainchild of There There, a 100% Eastern European performance company conjured up by Dana Olărescu + Bojana Janković. Originally commissioned by Giving in to Gift.    
           
**Output Arts | *Running with Scissors***         
Output Arts presents the ultimate in hazardous track games: *Running with Scissors* gives you the opportunity to really test your metal. Fabulous prizes to be won!             
         
Output Arts produces playful and poignant site-specific installations: drawing with light under a flyover; searching for stories of loss on the beach with mumbling metal detectors; a motion-triggered ringing WWII telephone in a shopping centre.

**un-earthed collective | *Inflated Hazard — dicing with dystopia***         
*Roll the dice, inflate the hazard…*             
Every generation has its defining threat: a world at war; nuclear holocaust; climate change; terrorism. The corporate media inflates these threats with sensationalism. What effect does this inflation of fear have on us?           
This playful, provocative performance invites the audience to roll giant inflatable dice in the street, allowing chance to dictate what follows then offering a chance to tell a different story.         
*What happens next? You decide.*         
         
*Inflated Hazard* takes the form of a series of timed performances and an [ongoing installation](/current/2016-hazard/ongoing) with which you can interact.        
          
**Jin Bells | *Head In Hole 2016***         
A pointless body, a meaningless action, a nonsensical intervention into the city...     
         
Emerging Manchester artist Jin Bells works between theatre and performance art and has undertaken a residency at CRASH2016 and has upcoming performances at Islington Mill, Salford and Tempting Failure Festival, London.          
               
**Charlotte CHW | *Caution: Falling…*** (no longer appears)            
Falling down, falling from grace, falling off, falling out.       
But falling isn't a work of art? People are doing it in public everyday. We just choose not to see it.           
You may not see her today, genuinely. She fights to conceal her public fall, but only so much privacy can ever be afforded in public and falling is not a crime.    
         
*Caution: Falling…* is a new movement-based public intervention by Charlotte CHW exploring collective anxiety and self absorption through absurdity.       
         
**Elena Koukoli + Andreas Papapetrou | *Out of Thin Air***           
Movement, voice and the rustling whisper of escaping air fill the Square momentarily with colour and noise. This meditation on emptiness and excess, scored by a soundtrack of deflation, invites its audience to take a deep breath and explore…         
         
A collaborative project between choreographer Elena Koukoli + composer Andreas Papapetrou.
