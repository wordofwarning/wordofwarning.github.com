**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, featuring at least 25 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester… 
             
Staged for the first time entirely in the cavernous realms of [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here), our **[fifteenth Emergency](/current/2014-emergency)** takes place on Saturday 4 October 2014 (12noon-10pm) — a free micro-marathon of the bizarre + the beautiful popping up all over the building; primarily an adult event, from 3pm onwards we advise that work may not be suitable for under 18s. To get a feel for it see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-emergency) + [gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).        
      
**Emergency is:**    
• a free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).
