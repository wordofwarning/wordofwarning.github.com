#### What is Word of Warning + where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond…          
        
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past four years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Action Hero, Michael Pinchbeck, Ria Hartley, Lowri Evans, the vacuum cleaner, Leentje Van de Cruys + Stacy Makishi amongst others. We've also created bonkers all ages live art ([Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org)), hosted [Hunt & Darton's pop-up art-café](/archive/2015-spring/h&d), unleashed bizarre behaviour upon Manchester's city centre ([Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org)) and created performance festivals in blocks of flats ([Domestic](http://domesticmcr.org)).

#### Who's it for? Anyone looking for a different night (or day) out.            
We don't want to put you off by talking labels – yes there'll be theatre, live art, dance – the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening – there'll be something you might want to take a chance on.

#### Who is Word of Warning?         
My name's Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called **[hÅb](/hab)**, which was greenroom's partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events – like **Emergency** (Manchester's free marathon of live work, now in its sixteenth year) and **Hazard** (biennial random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).

I've been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I've been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon Hallelujah chorus! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at <mailto:info@habarts.org>             

I'm joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom's long time programme co-ordinator. Often spotted in a hat or proffering a variety of bizarre refreshments, John is the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events. We are also grateful for the support of a growing band of hÅb-ettes — currently Afreena Islam, Catherine (Cat) Shaw + Sam Stockdale.
