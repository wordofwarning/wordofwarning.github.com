### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer and strategic advocate of contemporary performance, live art and sited work in the North of England. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy, working in collaboration with a range of venues to produce showing opportunities, platforms and artist development projects like [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Hazard](/hab/hazard), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), [Turn](/hab/turn) and [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).      
        
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with artists, colleagues and venues to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish.
        
Since January 2012, however hÅb gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/index) — a peripatetic programme of, and regular bulletin for, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond. *N.B. this site aims to offer information to artists wanting to know more about our work and how to get involved; for more information about our public programme please see [Word of Warning](/index).*   
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), an annual micro-festival for new live work (now entering its seventeenth year) which presents over 25 short pieces in a day each October and its Merseyside sibling, ['Poolside Emergency](/hab/poolside); through [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work — we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance and live art. We also co-produce the annual [Turn](/hab/turn) micro-festival for new NW dance + dance-makers each spring, and the ensuing Turn Prize.    
        
hÅb also works as a curator of sited performance and intervention presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention, taking performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre (next in July 2016), as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our more frequent foray into all ages live art in Z-arts.             
        
In any given year, hÅb might work with 200 artists, present 3 platforms, 1 sited festival and show over 100 pieces of work (under the guise of [Word of Warning](/index)).      
         
hÅb is supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council.
