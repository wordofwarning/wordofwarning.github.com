*Presented by* Word of Warning, STUN + Z-arts          

###Saturday 4 October 2014, 12noon-11pm. Free             
**Manchester’s marathon micro-festival celebrates its fifteenth birthday — expect the unexpected as the bizarre, the bold + the beautiful pop up throughout the cavernous realms of Z-arts…**      
                       
We've previously taped performers to windows, played a uniquely guttural rendition of Nessun Dorma and unearthed a viscerally prehistoric woman… This year's equally eclectic performance lucky-dip is staged entirely within Z-arts for the first time — your chance to sample the different and all for free.           

Drop-in for ten minutes or stay for the full eleven hours — a free day-out for the curious with over twenty-five new works; featuring artists (*subject to change*):            
Alice Bunker-Whitney ¦ Ana Mendes ¦ Anton Mirto ¦ Art Of Disappearing ¦ Barbara Dean ¦ Boland-Burrell + Byrne ¦ Debbie Sharp ¦ Eik + Orengo ¦ FM ¦ Frances-Kay ¦ Hamish MacPherson ¦ Hidden Track ¦ J. Fergus Evans ¦ Jade Montserrat ¦ Jamil Keating ¦ Jonathan Rogerson ¦ Krissi Musiol ¦ Lydia Cottrell ¦ Martin Hamblen ¦ Matthew Pearce ¦ Nathan Birkinshaw ¦ Neil Callaghan ¦ Odd Comic ¦ Olivia Preye ¦ Paul O'Donnell ¦ Peter Jacobs ¦ Rosanne Robertson ¦ VIA Collective
