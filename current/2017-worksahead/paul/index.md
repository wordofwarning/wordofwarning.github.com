#### More              
Exploring home-cooked food and family trees, whilst delving into the stories that unfold in her father's kitchen, the show examines the relationship between an 8-year-old girl and her estranged father, and the journey that follows 12 years on, whilst reflecting on hundreds of years of Jamaican history through memory & poetry.             
          
#### Who is she?             
Toni-Dee is a theatre maker, collaborator, writer, and performance artist from Leeds. Her practice explores identity politics, memory, and culture using auto-biography as stimulus for her work thus far. Toni has previously been commissioned by Fuel and has toured her mono-dialogue Rum Punch around the North of England; she has also worked with artists such as Andy Smith + Selina Thompson.
