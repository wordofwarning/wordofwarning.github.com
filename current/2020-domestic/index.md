#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For our [pilot "Domestic at home"](/current/2020-domestic/july), we invited six artists to try out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand… Join us online on Wednesday 12 August for a fresh set of commentaries on where we find ourselves now.
