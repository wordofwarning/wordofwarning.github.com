#### What people have said about Works Ahead        
>*A strong double bill tonight from @WarnMcr's ever-reliable #WorksAhead.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://twitter.com/CirclesStalls/status/1129503777566937088" target="_blank">@CirclesStalls on 2019</a><br>*Vital …allows artists to present the prepubescent stages of their work to an audience who are expecting something weird, personal and entirely half-done.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/features/works-ahead-expect-something-weird-personal-entirely-half-done" target="_blank">The State of The Arts on 2018</a><br>*A cathartic, funny and brutally honest show.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://afronalysis.com/2017/05/14/review-superposition-stun" target="_blank">Afronalysis on 2017</a><br>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless. They make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*<br>&nbsp;— <a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave on 2016</a><br>*Always an informal way to experience something a bit different.*<br>*Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.*<br>*Great to see new work by younger artists.*<br>*Higher standard than I was expecting of a work in progress … offered perspectives that I hadn't heard before.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience Feedback from 2019 + earlier years…
