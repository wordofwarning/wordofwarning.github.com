####Who Are They?

GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN is Hester Chillingworth, Lucy McCormick and Jennifer Pick, a London-based performance company, formed in 2008.

Together they play with failure, attempt, endurance, utterance, trashiness, the pathetic, triumph, mess.  Based in London, they make theatre pieces and live art together… so far.  

####Vanifesto

GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN:   
Make: broken genre performance  
Hold: a core belief in performance as dialogue      
Assert: that text does not always say what it says that it says it is saying      
Want: to transport you.

####More

Jen wants to talk to you. Lucy wants more.
They’ve got some stuff they found in a garage, a strict no-touch policy and conflicting ideas about how to keep you happy.

Maverick makers GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN went to see a show where the performers wrote them letters. They didn’t write back – instead this unravelling game of truth and lies is their response.

Hear them talk about the piece [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlvafgN31hs)

*External* hurls a conversation about authenticity and originality right out into the open and forces it to fight for its life, giggling, gnashing and doing its own head in.

Let’s get the party started.
