####Kitty Graham   *The Bare Earth*   
*You stand before a bed of earth. Perhaps it is empty, still, peaceful. Perhaps it is not.*	
Using a bed of earth, "the place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other", this piece explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.    

Kitty trained at Trinity Laban. During my time there I was lucky enough perform in work by Reinhild Hoffman, Zoi Dimitriou, Matteo Fargion and Marie-Gabriell Rotie, whose Butoh practice has been a great inspiration for this piece.    
####Nicola Smith   *Human Desktop*	    
Nicola Smith will become a human desk were the audience can explore their curiosity by simply sitting, looking, handling items, sharing stories and speaking directly to the artist.	Inspired by the artist at work, who not only uses the studio but also spends a lot of their time attached to their desk.  In fact most of her time is spent at a desk writing proposals, researching and making. This piece offers a unique insight into her daily practice. The audience can explore their curiosity and explore the artist's desk by simply looking, handling items, sharing stories and speaking directly to the artist.       

Nicola Smith is a visual artist who makes work in response to the context of her surroundings using different mediums such as live art intervention, performance, installation and video. She punctuates situations in public and private spaces by playing 'host' and acting out a series of actions. Smith's actions take on many forms such as public speaking, directing, singing and dancing in order to engage and disrupt the expectations of the audience. These performances happen in semi-public spaces to allow accidental audiences to take part.

####Sturgeon's Law   *Between Us (you and me)*    	                            	
*She tries not to care when you say cruel things about her. No matter what, she'll always love you.*      
A short, one on one performance based on a text by US author Daniel Abraham and adapted by his kind permission.	     

Sturgeon's Law is the name under which Aliki Chapple performs work that isn't quite theatre. Always text-based, this work has included installations, cabaret, durational pieces and pervasive games as well as interactive and one-on-one performances.

####Evans & Gaskell   *100 Deeds*    
A visual gathering of deeds to define feminism in the modern day	It is deeds that are needed, not words. We're just not sure what deeds they should be.    

100 years ago, a woman did something which was considered by everyone to be truly heroic/irrational/essential/extremist/empowering/detrimental.  When Emily Wilding Davison jumped in front of the King's horse, her action would go on to impact how a nation perceives feminism.    
 
We want to know what feminism means now, or perhaps what actions should happen next.  Come and tell us what you think and brand your own purple sash “ we will try to turn your words into deeds (100 of them).    

Sarah Evans makes work which often has love and justice at its heart with a slice of comedy, sometimes light, sometimes dark (often weather dependent). She loves creating personal story-based pieces which linger. She loves working on one-to-one, intimate performances and giving little tokens of love.    
Jenny Gaskell is a contemporary theatre maker and producer.  She has a habit of making, and supporting, theatre which doesn't happen in a theatre. Past credits include performance in a shopping centre, in a post office, in a toilet, in a cafe, on a tram, in an office & in a cupboard.    
####Julieann O’Malley   *Tour of Duty*	    
200 soldiers have completed their tours of duty but now find themselves in yet another unfamiliar territory.  Left alone to fend for themselves,  the soldiers' new mission is to conquer and survive the urban landscape of Manchester. Coloured gold and unable to shift or move from their military pose, they look on unnoticed: unsung heroes.     

On 21 July 2012, 150 soldiers were placed on the streets of Manchester to survive. The remaining 50 were given refuge in the kind homes of people willing to look after them.    

On the 12th October a search party will be sent out to rescue the survivors; to be exhibited as ultimate heroes of the City of Manchester on the 13th October 2012 as part of [emergency](http://emergencymcr.org)    

*How many will remain?*      

Julieann O'Malley is an interdisciplinary artist based in Liverpool, UK.  
"I make live performance, installation & video work that's raw, visceral, emotionally charged and evocative. I like to test the limits of my body as well as using it as a material in my work. I have a great fascination for the possibilities of the future of the human race  and am passionate about people's personal connections with one another and the world around them."
####Clare Charnley	   *Nail Bar*    
A place to discuss ideas while you have a manual worker's finger nail fitted - fake false finger nails painted to look soiled, split, bruised or generally affected by manual work. Each is a tiny painting.  Fitting it is an intimate situation involving close physical proximity and touch. As such, it provides a perfect opportunity for slow and thoughtful discussion with strangers. Lets talk...    

Much of Clare's work involves interaction with the public. She is particularly interested in using the work itself as a process of negotiation.

####Leo Olamerino   *I've been waiting for you*    
A one-man performance, devised in collaboration with Lowri Jones, using spoken word, projection and movement.    

You've been waiting for the kettle to boil, your train to arrive, and your lunch to be served. I've been waiting for you. The passing of time and the harsh weather have troubled my thoughts and my body. For the first or the thousandth time, I've been waiting for you to wait with me. You don't have to stay for long, but without you, I'm not much.    

Leo Olamerino is a theatre-based artist working primarily with artists collective, Fake|Simile.
