### Friday 28 April 2017, 7.30pm (plus Saturday, 7pm)
All the energy of this annual whirlwind of new northern dance condensed into just one (Friday) night. Fluidly lyrical, effervescently acrobatic or eccentrically innovative, let Turn transport you into a frenzy of dance.
           
### Artists        
In a new format, our ninth annual platform for dancers + dance-makers sees up to a dozen short new works on Friday Night (*participating artists tba early April*) with Mixed Movement closing Saturday's Artist Day.              
        
To get a feel for Friday Night, see Turn 2016's [programme](/archive/2016-turn) + [image gallery](/galleries/2016-turn).
