####Who Is Small Acts?

Performer, maker, lateral thinker, optimist, mother.

Julia has worked with Reckless Sleepers, Chameleons Theatre, Index Theatre and Dogs of Heaven, as well as making multi-media solo work. She has toured nationally and internationally, worked in Higher Education teaching live art, devised performance and directing as well delivering performance related papers at International symposia.    

####More

In Hollywood films, shower scenes are used to provide some completely unnecessary (usually female) nudity and/or heighten a sex or horror scene. Reversing the roles of cinematic spectatorship, participants are invited to relinquish their usual voyeuristic position, and take on the role of the one that is viewed; the naked and vulnerable.     

**You will be wet, naked (and alone) in this piece.**

####Works Ahead:Interactions

A journey around the hidden spaces of a theatre - one monumental installation, three intimate encounters... 

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-long *maze of performance*: [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/).  Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing emergency accommodation artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
