**Alexandrina Hemsley | *words collect under my soft palate, lips shut, soundless bubbling***         
A new video work by dance artist and writer Alexandrina Hemsley in which she deals with self-censoring as someone who experiences the silencing inherent in marginalisation and anti-blackness. This work continues the attempts of her artistic practice to retain multiplicity and morph the body’s narratives as a soft resistance to objectification and reductive epresentations. The work also aims to recapture her identities out of the clutches of the daily colonial frameworks which through their all pervasive nature, often force her to harden out of protection. Alongside this, it is a challenge to herself - as an artist who experiences heightened distress over her appearance - to look in the camera for more than a minute.         
Film and text by Alexandrina Hemsley;        
Sound: Alexandrina Hemsley using samples from Nina Simones Feelings" (live at Montreux Jazz Festival 1976).         
Originally screened at DECORUM X: The Worst of Censorship, V&A Museum                    

**Alexandrina** believes in dance & the body as a site for expressing felt & embodied politics. It is a life long project. The forms her artistic work takes frequently morph in order to present her concerns within shifting frames and contexts. She make dances, videos, self-produces and writes. She is interested in liminal spaces, connectivity, fracturing, displacement and emotionality. She collaborates with Jamila Johnson-Small as part of Project O (2011 onwards) and with Seke Chimutengwende on new work  Black Holes. Her works have been commissioned by Sadlers Wells, Somerset House, South Bank Centre, The Place, Cambridge Junction and Battersea Arts Centre among others.

**Alicia Jane Turner | *Elegie***         
A one-to-one piece that explores the way we experience live music performance. In pitch black, Alicia performs a classical piece for each audience member, an invisible solo violinist performing for an invisible solo audience member. With all theatrical displays of virtuosity removed, this performance aims to destabilise the notions of how we listen, drawing focus onto the intimacy and vulnerability of music performance, the body performing and the body listening, and how we can form connections through sound alone.                        
           
**Alicia Jane Turner** is a composer, performer and sound artist working across live art, theatre, and new classical music. Her practice focuses on the visceral affectivity of sound and live music in performance, exploring physicality, identity and intimacy.She has toured her solo and collaborative performances internationally and across the UK and recently premiered her new classical compositions in America.

A live performance work that explores relationships between the politicised body and the power dynamics of dominant culture. An investigation into socio-political frameworks and how we might exist within those frameworks.

**Paper People Theatre | *These Walls (working title)***

**Penelope Harrall | *You name it, we've dumped it***         
We are killing the ocean and everything in it with our over consumption of plastics. Plastic bottles, plastic bags, plastic toothbrushes, plastic beer rings - you name it, we’ve dumped it.  A durational performance: the contradiction of a beautifully made dress and what it is made out of signifies the beauty of our ocean and what the humans are doing to it.          
     
**Penelope Harrall** primarily uses Performance and Video Art as a platform to communicate views on social and political issues. Never using traditional material as means of creating her artwork - tampons, sanitary pads, plastic bags, sweets - by dislocating these objects the pieces become a playful take on sculpture intertwining with performance. Harrall endeavours to bring art to everyone, it is her belief that art is an essential way of bringing people and communities together that would not necessarily connect. With a desire to allure and disrupt the audience simultaneously Harrall uses and emphasises her own body, a reoccurring motif throughout, whether it be obviously present or not, her body acts like a signature for her work.

Talk with me, let’s make conversation. What do we put together, sharing what we know through our hands, our bodies, our words? This one-to-one interaction focuses on conversation as a process of collaborative creation. Inviting participants into a dialogue conducted through both words and clay, it explores themes of body knowing and body memory, celebrating the unique unwritten knowledge we each hold in our bodies, and exchanging experience through the listening and speaking of words and hands.
