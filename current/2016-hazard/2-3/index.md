#### 2.30-3pm           
**Jin Bells | *Head in Hole 2016***         
Floating, completely still with my head buried in a hole in a wall… this meaningless action seeks to confront its audience, whether they are suspecting or not…           
          
#### 2.30-3.30pm           
**Vivian Chinasa Ezugha | *Because of hair***           
"I am not historical, I am not futuristic, I am not the old nor am I the new. I am but an object made from human hair. My purpose is to disturb, to interrupt your contemplation and seduce your vision; so that I become an image of your imagination."

**Alex Bradley + Bill Leslie | *COME AS YOU ARE (guerrilla mix 1.0)***

**Instant Dissidence | *Dancing with Strangers: From Calais to England***

**Nathaniel Mason | *Occupied***          
Dying, desperate, gagging, bursting. This archive of public convenience is made by the people for the people.           
            
**Sexcentenary | *WE REFUSE TO BE UNSEEN***
