####More      
Fergus has lived in England for almost seven years. He hasn’t been back to his hometown in five.        
           
*my heart is hitchhiking down peachtree street* is a one-man show about living far away from home. It’s about the stories you tell people when they ask you where you’re from. It’s about learning that once you leave, you can’t go back.        
          
Using animation, storytelling, and spoken word, the show is about trying to make sense of where you come from when you’re very far from home.

####Who is he?    
J. Fergus Evans is a yarn-spinnin', boy-kissin' spoken word + performance artist.           
        
His work focuses on restaging spoken word using video, soundscaping and sculpture. He deftly weaves poetry, theatre, and installation into tapestries saturated with lived experience and half-imagined fantastical landscapes.           
          
Previous work includes (among other things) a forest created from over a thousand donated sympathy cards; he has created work with a number of leading arts organisations including Contact, The Albany, and BAC; he is also a certified life coach and independent producer.
