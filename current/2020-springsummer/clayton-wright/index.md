#### More         
Harry Clayton-Wright explores how we learn about sex and how it shapes our lives, blending a no-holds-barred interview with his mum, startling performance, moving storytelling, and some good old-fashioned gay porn that his dad bought for him when he was 14.           
        
Delivered with the candour, positivity, and charm that have made him an acclaimed international touring success (*Briefs: Close Encounters*), join Harry as he delves into his sexual past, live on stage: the good, the bad and everything in between. This is a show for anyone who's wondered why they want what they want.        
         
#### Who is he?        
Harry  is? Brighton Fringe Award winner (2017). Total Theatre Award nominee (2019).         
        
#### What people have said about him         
>★★★★ *Clayton-Wright has complete control over the room's mood. Achingly funny, filthy and tender.* The Guardian<br>★★★★ *Extraordinary. An exuberant, propulsive and often hilarious hour.* The Scotsman 

>*Often the eerie silence, combined with Cassani’s deliberately perfunctory performance, made the show uncomfortable viewing, and yet it was impossible to look away…*<br><a href="http://www.whatsonlive.co.uk/birmingham/news/our-be-festival-review-round-up/44721" target="_blank">★★★★ Ellie Hutchings, What's on Birmingham</a><br>*• Very accomplished performance. A powerful presence throughout.*<br>*• Beautiful, loved the eye contact. Exciting, vulnerable.*<br>Audience Feedback
