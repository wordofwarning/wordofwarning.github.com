####More            
Victoria unknowingly discovered that her basset hound (Major Tom) had prize-winning potential at a charity dog show and seized the opportunity to access the subculture of this extraordinarily exclusive member’s only club. Major Tom’s first championship show was a disaster and, feeling an overpowering sense of guilt about her dog being scrutinised, Victoria decided to put herself through the same process by becoming a beauty queen.             
             
Major Tom and Victoria increasingly immersed themselves into the obsessive and confusing realm of personal scrutiny as they participated as genuine contestants and aimed to win — Major Tom went to Crufts, with Victoria at 34 and 5ft 4 competing in Mrs England 2013; she currently holds the title of Mrs Brighton.          
             
This one woman, one dog show follows their story, reflecting on the British fascination with celebrities, beauty, and winning.
