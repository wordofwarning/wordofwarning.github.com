#### In Brief    
Jam sessions, patter with a Southern drawl, big dance numbers, and a bit of sweat: this is a re-enactment of Elvis Presley's *1968 Comeback Special*. Sort of.

#### More      
It's an experiment in time drag; wearing another time as drag and dragging another time into the present. What happens if the *Comeback* comes back? Like a half-remembered dream or two mirrors facing each other or repeating a word so much it loses its meaning.        
         
*Comeback Special* is a double negative. It's not the original, but it's not *not*.        
         
Greg welcomes Elvis fans, theatre fans and anyone who thinks this peculiar re-enactment might be fun. He certainly does.          
         
#### Who is he?     
Greg Wohead is a writer, performer and live artist; originally from Texas, he makes make theatre performances, one-to-one pieces and audio work — most recently for Word of Warning in 2013's [Domestic](/archive/2013-domestic/wohead).             
         
His work sometimes orbits around larger-than-life American icons, for better or worse; recently he's been preoccupied with surrogates, re-enactments and radical manifestations of masculinity.         
         
Prioritising a sense of the personal and the exposing, his practice veers between writing and actions, hilarity and disgust, things that are obvious and things that are left unsaid; he tries never to make the same piece twice.            
         
In the past his work has mainly been a solo practice, but recently he's enjoyed collaborations with artists like Rachel Mars + Joe Wild, among others.<br>He's shown and developed new work internationally at Battersea Arts Centre, Bristol Old Vic, Ovalhouse, Mayfest, Pulse Festival, Northern Stage, Chapter Arts Centre, Forest Fringe, MC (Amsterdam), Orchard Project (New York), MAKE (Ireland), Bios (Athens), LAX Festival (Los Angeles), Fusebox Festival (Austin) + ArtPower (San Diego).<br>Greg is an Associate Artist at The Yard + Shoreditch Town Hall in London.           
         
#### What people have said about *Comeback Special*         
>*Although Presley is the ghostly heart of it, it's neither an act of homage nor a simple nostalgia trip… by blurring the line between performers and their public, as well as the past and the present, Wohead creates a special bond.*<br><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/firstnightreviews/article4725184.ece" target="_blank">★★★★ Donald Hutera, The Times</a>        
>*He catches the swagger, the sex appeal, the smile. His attention is exacting – so concentrated and precise – and the process of transforming is transfixing: both electric and ghoulish. There's the air of a séance: a comeback special.*<br><a href="http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/comeback-special-shoreditch-town-hall_40045.html" target="_blank">Matt Trueman, Whatonstage</a>        
>*Drained of the bright, synthetic colour of 1960s fashion, Wohead's version is a shadow or skeleton of the original event. Recreated in monochrome, this is a black-and-white negative of the 1968 Comeback Special. An echo. A ghost.*<br><a href="http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/review-comeback-special-at-shoreditch-town-hall" target="_blank">Catherine Love, Exeunt Magazine</a>
