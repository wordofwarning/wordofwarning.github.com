#### Schedule (*Participating Artists subject to change*)        
**Kris Canavan | *Back To Basics***         
A citizen of nowhere followed blindly a yellow brick road + stumbled across a group of hooded individuals concocting a ritual with pigs heads… The citizen bowed their head + surreptitiously pressed on. After a short period they happened upon an abandoned farm with decaying fields of wheat + a sign that read: *DREAMS DIED HERE*; with a deep sense of foreboding, the citizen pressed on.<br>Finally the citizen reached a clearing + saw a man wearing the mask of a clown, holding his Johnson in a pair of garden shears, apparently preparing to castrate himself. *Truly*, the citizen thought, *all roads do lead to shit*.<br>Since 2001 **Kris** has used their body as a site to be manipulated, contorted, sculpted, pierced + mined for the creation of artworks. They see their methods used in the creation of artworks (by utilising their body + its resources) as a political ownership of their body, a rejection of the status quo + subservience that is expected of us by the state — essentially their works can be viewed as gestures of defiance + dissent.<br>See age advisory + content warning [here](/warnings).<br><a href="http://twitter.com/kriscanavan" target="_blank">@kriscanavan</a>            
         
              
**Shkiesha | *Con Verse Cups***            
An exploration of the emotional + complexity dynamics of navigating boundaries + gaining consent. It uses movements inspired by the interaction of matter guided by opposing forces to reflect on the common dynamics we all recognise in a relationship.<br>Created by Shkiesha + developed with Lyudmila. A Divergency micro-commission.           
<br>See age advisory + content warning [here](/warnings).          
          
**TomYumSim | *HOTLINE***

Call now for a good time.<sup>+</sup>*<br>*HOTLINE* is a voicemail performance platform that subverts the need for tickets + theatres, giving the audience direct access to the show. *HOTLINE* harks back to late-night chat lines, rave location information services + a time when phone-to-phone communication ruled.<br>*Grab your phone + dial to give you a smile:* 0161 850 6739 or 0777 435 1868. *Alter-natively, come by when I'm sitting in the phone booth + listen in to me taking calls LIVE!*<br><sup>+</sup>At least 30 seconds of good time guaranteed.<br>**Tom Halls** is one half of fantastical theatre duo, TomYumSim.
