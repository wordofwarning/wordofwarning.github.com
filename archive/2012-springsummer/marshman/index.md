####Who is he?

Hello, I'm Tom Marshman.

My shows are hand crafted, intimate, naughty, humorous, high brow, low brow, sensory, stomach churning, conversational, sentimental, physically demanding, staged and chance encounters. I have outrageous costumes and smart suits, eclectic music, sweet things to taste, a poetic voice and brutally honest language. My shows are low camp, moving, hit and run, fragile and memorable. And all made with an overwhelming desire to engage, seduce and entertain I’ve been making performance for over ten years, and created over 20 projects in a wide range of mediums including performance, photography, installation, publication and film. 

I have shown work in a variety of venues including Bristol Old Vic, Arnolfini (Bristol), Oval House, Chapter Arts Centre, Battersea Arts Centre, Basement Brighton, Colchester Arts Centre, Exeter Phoenix and within Festivals including National Review of Live Art, Inbetween Time and White Nights.

Collaborators include: Dan Canham, Sam Halmarack, Ben Pollock, Ziggy Jacobs, Neil Bartlett MBE, Michael Pinchbeck, Bryony Kimmings, Mamoru Iriguchi,  Clara Giraud.

Tom Marshman is mingling with fashionistas&hellip; but will his winning smile pull him through?

Tom has an ambiguous relationship to his legs. He has suffered from varicose veins for a number of years, leading to discomfort, embarrassment and a series of operations. A new-found confidence encouraged Tom to delve into a world of celebrity, stockings, photoshoots, beauty pageants and gender misadventures, so imagine his surprise when he was shortlisted for the Pretty Polly *Best Legs of 2011* competition (and finished in 6th place).

In this intimate performance, Tom conveys a brave story of transformation, hospital visits and rejuvenation, running a half marathon and remembering past embarrassments. Heart-warming and funny, the show celebrates misfits through personal stories, songs and charmingly camp dances.
