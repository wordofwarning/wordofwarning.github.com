####More       
SheepKnuckle are two young men going to extraordinary lengths to avoid being on a stage… so what exactly are they doing here?    

In this celebration of collective performance anxiety, they cede centre stage to an audience-turned-performer, to become remote whispering guides through an intimate conversation and a performance of the everyday.    
 
*Echo* is a love story you have already heard but are yet to take part in...

####Who are they?    
SheepKnuckle are James Monaghan + Padraig Confrey, who make work that manifests itself often as an experiment; who are interested in using interactive media and ‘the self’ to challenge and de-construct traditional dramaturgy. They met at Salford University in their first year and have been in love ever since.
