#### Who is she?     
Glasgow-based, FK's practice centres on aggressive healing, radical wellness, public vulnerability, noise music, and 12 step recovery… She believes personal transformation is real, deep change is possible, and that we are all trying to recover from something/one.

Making work by herself and with others for no-one in particular, she strongly welcomes everyone — whether that work be live art or to go on a stage, the street, on headphones, in front of a camera, on a wall, or on a page.
