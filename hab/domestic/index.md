**Autumn 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes…       
        
**In Autumn 2015, Domestic II** will be unleashed on a new tower block in a new location somewhere in the Manchester conurbation; this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment, we will be occupying a space in transition: not quite a building-site, not quite a home…   
    
**[Domestic II now seeks proposals](http://habmcr.posthaven.com/domestic-ii-call-for-proposals)** from artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts for small pieces of live work to occupy one floor of this tower block — for one day — for an audience that can roam the floor ‘gallery-style’. Deadline Friday 10 July.      
        
Installation, durational and intimate performance work will lend themselves most easily to the environment. We are looking for pieces than can work with the building itself – essentially issue-led and socially engaged practice able to respond to its environment – be it a derelict bathroom, a stripped bare living room, a dingy corridor or a crumbling kitchen.

It will be rough, it will be low-tech, it will be unpredictable! The building itself is a work-in-progress, so the spaces themselves will be a bit of an adventure… We envisage spaces will range from completely gutted flats, through semi-stripped spaces with original walls and kitchen/bathroom fixtures in situ, to almost finished refurbished flats. To get a feel for it, have a look at [2013's image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).   

**Domestic II will be curated by [hÅb](/hab) on the basis of suitability to curatorial vision, technical + logistical feasibility, with Criteria:**      
**1** Artistic merit of proposed ideas and clarity of proposal;     
**2** Priority will be given to live art/contemporary performance/time-based media work;        
**3** Priority will be given to socially engaged work;      
**4** Work which has already been shown publicly in Greater Manchester will not be highest priority;        
**5** GENERAL CRITERIA:     
● pieces must be the artist's own, original work;       
● the artist must hold copyright/ownership of the piece and materials included;     
● artists must conform with statutory and local authority (Salford) rules concerning health and safety, obscenity and defamation;     
● Equal Opportunities will be employed in the selection and programming in line with Manchester City Council and Arts Council England guidelines;        
● the focus is primarily on non-linear performative work from a cross-artform background; we advise that work that is PRIMARILY theatre, poetry, music, visual art or dance would be better served by proposing to a different context.
