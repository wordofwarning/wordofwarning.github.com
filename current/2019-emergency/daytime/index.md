**Emergency Chorus | *Mr Jet***           
*Please stay seated. Unattended security guards may be destroyed. This performance contains flashers + nothing much else of interest. The emergency exits are located now, then, + whenever. Please ensure your devices remain calm.*<br>Drawing from the language of customer service, public safety announcements + emergency protocols, *Mr Jet* reveals two ushers haunting the plush red seats of a disused theatre.<br>Created + performed by **Ben Kulvichit** + **Clara Potter-Sweet**.<br>Emergency Chorus (*Landscape (1989)*, *CELEBRATION*) is an award-winning theatre company making performances which engage with the contemporary moment with energy + playfulness.

**Kelvin Atmadibrata | *Forcing Hyacinth***          
One foot partially submerged in cold water, his other foot on the ground, struggling to keep his fulcrum upright. In his hand a familiar plastic milk bottle, filled with bubble liquid. Slowly he blows into a straw, hyacinth-shaped bubbles sprouting from his mouth. *Forcing Hyacinth* silently weaves a narrative that hints at the Greek mythology of the hyacinth flower + the botany process of forcing bulbs to flower — a commentary on the pressure, self-inflicted or otherwise, of growing up.<br>**Kelvin** (b.1988, Jakarta, Indonesia) channels super- + anti-heroes awakened by puberty + adolescent fantasy to confront masculine stereotypes in Southeast Asia.<br><a href="http://kelvinatmadibrata.com" target="_blank">kelvinatmadibrata.com</a>          
          
**Kris Canavan | *Back To Basics***         
A citizen of nowhere followed blindly a yellow brick road + stumbled across a group of hooded individuals concocting a ritual with pigs heads… The citizen bowed their head + surreptitiously pressed on. After a short period they happened upon an abandoned farm with decaying fields of wheat + a sign that read: *DREAMS DIED HERE*; with a deep sense of foreboding, the citizen pressed on.<br>Finally the citizen reached a clearing + saw a man wearing the mask of a clown, holding his Johnson in a pair of garden shears, apparently preparing to castrate himself. *Truly*, the citizen thought, *all roads do lead to shit*.<br>Since 2001 **Kris** has used their body as a site to be manipulated, contorted, sculpted, pierced + mined for the creation of artworks. They see their methods used in the creation of artworks (by utilising their body + its resources) as a political ownership of their body, a rejection of the status quo + subservience that is expected of us by the state — essentially their works can be viewed as gestures of defiance + dissent.<br>See age advisory + content warning [here](/warnings).<br><a href="http://twitter.com/kriscanavan" target="_blank">@kriscanavan</a>            
          
**Maya Chowdhry | *DiGesture***

**Peter Jacobs | *Hypertension (I'm over here, why can't you see me)***

He is also interested in dystopian worlds, censorship, ageing, masculinity + male sexual identity.<br><a href="http://peter-jacobs.weebly.com" target="_blank">peter-jacobs.weebly.com</a>            
          
**Pierce Starre | *Labels***           
Labelling is an evolutionary process utilised to reconcile feelings in relation to our understanding of the complex nature of our existence. The categorisation of facts +  the description of emotion is an intrinsic component of communication.<br>However, as landscapes expand, many are moving away from the specific, restrictive pigeonholing a label can bring + merely tagging themselves "Me". The artist explores the effects of labels by sitting, still + silent in the space, holding a roll of sticky labels. The viewer is invited to tear a label + to write a response about the individual they see in front of them. The viewer is then encouraged to stick the label onto the artist.<br>**Pierce** is a Liverpool-based artist + organises DRIP Liverpool's *Spill Yer Tea* events.<br>See age advisory + content warning [here](/warnings).<br><a href="http://www.piercestarre.com" target="_blank">piercestarre.com</a>

**Ross Graham | *Making Histry***             
*My name is Ross, I have a bad memory + I love crisps. Join me in crossing nearly 100 years of difference, + the invincible void of death, in order to meet the only grandparent I never knew.
