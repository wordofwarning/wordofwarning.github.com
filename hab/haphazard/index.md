**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging, and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids + their adults, adults + *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!        

Our **fifth Haphazard will take place in April 2019 at Z-arts** and we'll be seeking artist proposals in January — meanwhile, get your thinking caps on!          
          
Our **[fourth Haphazard](/archive/2017-haphazard)** took place on April Fool's afternoon 2017 (Saturday 1 April, 12noon-4pm) with a baker's dozen of free activity — *sing-a-long with a fish, walk like Sponge Bob, dance with a bear, or play a trick on your friends…* Previously, Z-arts has seen ping pong balls + squeaky toys; human dogs, cats, giant rats + the Gendersaurus Rex; hula-hooping + human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet + a tiny bee-shaped world…
