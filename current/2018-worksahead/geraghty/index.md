*Fat Girl Singing* is an autobiographical one woman show looking at music and the body positivity movement. This is about using your voice when everything is telling you to shut up. It's an exorcism, a raised fist, a hug. It's a journey towards positivity and loud, unapologetic defiance.           
          
#### Who is she?             
Emma Geraghty is a writer, director, and performer. Her solo work in theatre and writing focuses on body positivity and representations of queerness, and she explores contemporary politics through different theatrical styles with the award-winning company Powder Keg.
