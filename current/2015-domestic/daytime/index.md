**Threshold | *1989 called…***      
A sonic silhouette, an artist's self-portrait created from the substance of absence.        
           
*1989 called…* shapes a sonic silhouette, an artist's self-portrait in their absence created from the substance left behind that might define them. In this case, the portrait is created from genuine answer phone messages left by friends, recorded in 1989. We listen in on someone else's life as disembodied voices from the past hint at relationships, events, both real and imagined, and imply a character to this absent recipient for whom the messages were once intended.    
         
*1989 called…* is an ongoing domestic installation.

**Clare Charnley | *Flat Pack***            
Charnley turns things inside out as she makes furniture from its packaging. 
A contemplation on obsolescence in dialogue with the public, Clare is making repro just-out-of-date furniture for this new space. What on earth does she think she’s doing? And why?  Construction and dialogue.

**Mackenzie & Reed | *Natura Naturans***             
An experimental work that asks, is a space ever really uninhabited?    
Acting as enablers, Mackenzie and Reed test the flaws in our current definition of the word ‘life’ by allowing the activity of unseen living matter within the room to become performer. Using a combination of live hack-microscopy, projection and sound recording within the seemingly uninhabited domestic space, Mackenzie & Reed reveal that the room is alive and coax it into a collaborative performance.    
*Natura Naturans* is an ongoing performance installation.    

Louise Mackenzie is a mixed-media artist creating installation, sculpture, performance, sound and film works since 2009. Currently researching living matter as material, she enables unpredictable relationships between medium, sound, image and text.    
Mark Reed is a freelance sound recordist, artist and would-be hermit philosopher.  A graduate of Popular and Contemporary Music at Newcastle University, Mark has expertise in sound design, composition and recording, managing sound production.     
Supported by Northumbria University.

**Jamil E-R Keating | *Asteroid RK1***      
How close is too close for something so far?	    
An installation-story about asteroids and alcoholism, meteorites and human rights, comets in the night-sky and care in the city. Rotations, revolutions and realisations...    

*Asteroid RK1* is a looping 15 minute performance installation for small groups.    

An interdisciplinary artist interested in theatre and live art, Jamil has developed an auto-biographical coming of age solo-show for hÅb’s Works Ahead and pieces for Hazard and Emergency.

**Leo Burtin | *Between Us***        
A brief encounter with a stranger about the bits of life you'd like to never forget.  A conversation for one person at a time.    

It’s a short story, a snapshot of the everyday.  You are invited to celebrate the things that matter to you, to commemorate the small things, the bits of life which you’d like to remember.    

What is your 4th July? Whose birthday would you never forget? When did you take your first steps?     
     
*Between Us* is a performance for one person at a time.    
 
Devised by Leo Burtin as part of the Homemade series, a series of artworks which seek to provoke complex conversations by gently disrupting familiar and domestic contexts and concepts.

**Charlotte CHW | *Body-Wake***             
 An intimate durational live art installation using the body and movement, film and ceramic sculpture to explore the physical and mental impact of life in a degenerating body.    
                        
This highly personal work uses the bodily presence, film, overlapping abstract soundscapes and ceramics to explore the physical and mental impact of living in a degenerating body, mirrored in an intimate semi-derelict environment.
    
*Body Wake* is a repeating performance for small groups.

Charlotte CHW is a multidisciplinary artist based in Hastings primarily working in the realms of live art, sculpture, sound and installation and where the boundaries of these mediums do or don’t lie. Primary interests in her work lie in the societal anxiety surrounding physical and mental health and the presentation of this. She attempts to translate emotional honesty to physicality and portray the ebbs and flows of the human body.

**Afreena Islam | *Daughters of the Curry Revolution***         
When I was little, I used to hang out at my dad's restaurant every weekend, back when they used to stay open until 5am. After a hard days toil running round like I owned the place for a bit, I would fall asleep to the CCTV; my body on the chest freezer, and my head resting on a pile of tablecloths.    
*The Daughters of the Curry Revolution* is a reflection on my dad's life; from his journey to this country, to his journey to this day. 

*Daughters of the Curry Revolution* is a repeating performance for small groups.    
  
Last seen trading secrets in a Liverpool shed for ‘Poolside Emergency, Afreena normally makes work as one half of Manchester-based interactive theatre company, PGB. She calls herself an artist only when she’s got something to say, the rest of the time she manages Divergency, sits on Contact’s board, and is an Associate for London-based interactive theatre-makers, Coney. This is her first solo work.

**Ana Mendes | *Backspace***             
An audio play about anorexia in which audiences interact with a distorted mirror. Funny, witty, but also truthful, try it if you dare to be on the other side of the mirror.    

*Backspace* is an audio experience for one person at a time.
