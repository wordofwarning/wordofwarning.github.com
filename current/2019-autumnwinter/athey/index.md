#### More         
Inspired in part by the secret society of *<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C3%A9phale" target="_blank">Acéphale</a>* — the 1930s anti-fascist review and magazine published by philosopher Georges Bataille — Ron Athey attempts to make sense of a current reality where neo-fascism is mutating, creeping, and marching.<br><br>Turning to the *Acéphale* — the eponymous figure of the headless man and powerful symbol of radical transformation — Athey's new work uses projections, readings, lectures, appropriated text, and sound…        
        
>*<a href="http://www.documentjournal.com/2019/05/blood-christ-and-shock-value-the-gospel-according-to-ron-athey" target="_blank">…in some ways, this headless warrior is a perfect metaphor for Trump’s America?</a>*        
        
Making full use of his pioneering S&M practice, and by re-imagining cut-up technique pioneer Brion Gysin's brutalist *Pistol Poem* as a vocal/percussive choreography, Athey presents "a political satire of sorts" in this radically transformative ritual for resistance.          
         
#### Who is he?        
An iconic figure in contemporary art and performance, American artist Ron Athey has been pursuing the transcendent and sublime through performance for more than three decades. Best known for his boundary-pushing body mutilations, Athey's earliest performances were in LA's early 80s underground music scene. During the 90s he rose to international prominence making work that explored challenging subjects like the relationships between desire, sexuality and traumatic experience, and confronted conservative narratives around AIDS, S&M, and body autonomy.<br><br>Expanding into solo performances, collaborations, experimental theatre, and opera projects, his work invents new forms of ritual and celebration — conjuring the sacred as an antidote to the empty individualism of contemporary life, and pushing towards the merging of humans and gods.<br><br>Often questioning the limits of artistic practice, *<a href="http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/publishing/pleading-in-the-blood-the-art-of-ron-athey" target="_blank">Pleading in the Blood: The Art and Performances of Ron Athey</a>* (published 2013) delves into his frequently bloody portrayals of life, death, crisis, and fortitude in the time of AIDS.           
         
#### What people have said about *Acephalous Monster*         
>*…rich, multi-layered …a seismic sensory overload, leaving the audience punch-drunk.*<br><a href="http://www.list.co.uk/article/112027-ron-athey-acephalous-monster" target="_blank">★★★★★ The List</a><br>*…a delirious five-part multimedia performance, equal parts operatic and punk rock, and littered with citations from other artists including Georges Bataille, Genesis P-Orridge and Brion Gysin.*<br><a href="http://elephant.art/notorious-performance-artist-ron-athey-secret-societies-apocalypse" target="_blank">ELEPHANT.art magazine</a><br>*Fun isn’t the word I’d use to describe the work. In fact, fun is about as far from the experience as you can get. That’s not to say the piece lacks color, attitude, or wit. It has all of those…*<br><a href="https://www.dance-enthusiast.com/features/impressionsreviews/view/Ron-Atheys-Acphalous-Monster-Performance-Space-New-York" target="_blank">The Dance Enthusiast</a>
