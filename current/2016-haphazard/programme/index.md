#### Timed Activity (*subject to change*)        
**12.30pm, 1.30pm, 2.30pm, 3.30pm — Katy Dye | *RATS!***        
Crawling in our kitchens and blocking up our drainpipes, nibbling at our cornflakes and scratching at our doorsteps… dirty, smelly, flea-bitten, disease-ridden, ugly, amazing *RATS!* A 10 minute performance that explores rodent reputation and tries to redress the balance — after all, it's a hard life being a rat!

**1pm & 3pm — Marcus Orlandi | *Two Reeler* †**        
Inspired by the early era films of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, everyday household objects are misused, misunderstood and confused. A 15 minute performance — expect slapstick, awkwardness and tuneless song!

Meet the *Gendersaurus Rex* — the genial host of this gender-busting fashion show like no other — a 15 minute performance… with dinosaurs!

#### Activity All Afternoon (*subject to change*)        
**Artizani | *The Bees: Colony***        
Multiple handmade hives, each hiding an unexpected honey-scented world to challenge, charm and confound expectation. Tended by ethereal beekeepers, visitors participate in multi-sensory micro-experiences of sight, sound, taste, smell and touch.

>*Bees!… has done much to raise the quality of outdoor performing arts… something different and distinctive* — Lyn Gardner, The Guardian         
        
**Doris La Trine | *Flushed!***        
Doris La Trine has finally come out of her (water) closet as it's time she said goodbye to her beloved Len, her golden giant toilet, a queer couple. A feminist visual and physical tragic-comedy.

**Flipbook People | *Flipbook Live* †**        
Remember body flipbooks? Some of the characters have come to life! And you have an opportunity to join them as a flipbook character of your own creation: a 'swimming cowboy clown' or 'hula dancing doctor king'. It's up to you!

**Gareth Cutter | *I Am A Volcano***        
A volcano is getting ready to erupt… active and ominous, this volcano isn't magma-powered but fuelled by voice alone. The more sounds you add the more unpredictable it becomes, in a collective climactic audience shout, hiss, or growl…

**Katy Baird | *The Free Market***        
Katy is selling her entire wardrobe — in a bid to change herself. Don't bring cash, but bring your ideas and get rid of those February blues in this sale of the season. *Everything must go!*

**Lucy McCormick | *Animal Study***        
Part Disney film, part #LOLcat vine: Man is Dog, Woman is Cat but without the furry façade. A roaming challenge to sensible public behaviour.<br>*Can you see the kitty? Perhaps she is sitting on the wall. Oh look there's a doggy too, and he wants to play!*

**Same Difference | *A Few Feet Up***         
Just above our heads is an entirely different and unexplored realm — always present but just out of reach. Use our giant periscope to see a familiar place anew for a literal and metaphorical change of perspective.

**Travelling Lights | *Ludicrously Luminous***        
Digital meets steampunk in this mesmerising lightshow, as a spiral of light colour and pattern swirls above your head. An eccentric trio of machines — re-fashioned beer pumps, an old laundry mangle and the mysterious Helical Morphosis Configurator — put the control in your hands.
