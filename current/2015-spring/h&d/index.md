####More   
*Hunt & Darton Cafe are proud to satisfy appetites in more ways than one.*                   
                      
An award-winning pop-up cafe — which isn't just arty, it is ART. A fully functioning cafe that blends art with the everyday — a social and artistic hub where spontaneity and performance meet great food and drink.
                      
Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton expose the inner workings of their business by presenting everything as art — from the food served, the people serving, the décor and public display of their bank balance to the lovingly hand-picked charity shop crockery.               
                      
*Hunt & Darton Cafe* encourages playful participation and meaningful social encounters — through its alternative service from hosts Hunt & Darton in their iconic fruit or veggie attire, comic interaction through their "set menu" performances, guest waiters and themed days such as "You-Do-It" or "Health & Safety" day. Popping-up throughout March as the hub for Manchester's SICK! Festival, guest waiters include Pigeon Theatre, Nikki Hobday + Sara Cocker and Erini Kartsaki.                     
                      
Theme days responding to SICK! Festival's themes include "Sexy day" — with customers encouraged to speak frankly about sex, and phallic food served, accompanied by sexual innuendos; hosted talks will also approach these themes, collaborating with medical practitioners, academics, artists and local groups. Imagine being served tea whilst getting that leg looked at! Or perhaps a bowl of Coco Pops served up with a conversation about mental health.
                      
####Who are they?                
Hunt & Darton are a Live Art Collaboration between Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton, graduating together from Central Saint Martins in 2003. They approach Live Art from a Fine Art background, working across mediums with a sculptural approach to performance, choreographing words and movement in a sensory way and setting up alternative spaces — often creating installations to perform within. Their work derives from shared celebrations and anxieties surrounding life choices particularly as women, in Britain, now — and has been described as deadpan and absurd, often collapsing into humour. They have a persistent fetish within their practice to consistently re-assess their relationship with their audience — embracing awkward moments, risk taking and constantly trying to close the gap between performer and viewer — opting for a raw, underdone, conversational aesthetic.            
                      
Hunt & Darton are associate artists at Artsadmin + Cambridge Junction.
