#### In Brief
Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around this historic building – take a wander and see what you stumble upon... living geometric shapes making moon music, a bonkers bucket dance, marathon hula-hooping and bouncy, squeaky, ping-pong performers...    

Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft, this is a day for kids and their adults; adults and *their* adults – in short, anyone looking for a different day-out.    

**Check back here soon as we are still confirming artists!**
