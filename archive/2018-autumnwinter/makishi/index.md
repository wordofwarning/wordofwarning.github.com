#### More         
Part ritual; part prayer; part rowdy revivalist rally — *The Comforter* sees Stacy Makishi return with a follow-up to [2015's *Vesper Time*](/archive/2015-autumnwinter/makishi), in a rite of passage that reclaims spirituality and proposes a new perspective on church.        
          
>*The Comforter* wishes to comfort and to confound… to make a sacred space for disco, divine, party and paradox. — <a href="http://gcn.ie/interview-wonderful-queer-live-collision-headliner-stacy-makish/" target="_blank">Stacy Makishi</a>            
             
Exchanging psalms and sacrament for 80s/90s pop culture, and drawing inspiration from *Twin Peaks* and Ingmar Bergman, Stacy throws a kiss to George Michael…            
          
Following *Vesper Time*, *The Comforter* is show two in her trilogy about the Holy Trinity — and, as the Holy Ghost of the trio, asks the question: ‘What am I unwilling to feel?’               
           
#### Who is she?        
A multi-award winning artist who has been making work for over 30 years, Stacy Makishi is a transplant from Hawaii who found paradise in Dalston, East London in 1994.            
       
After graduating from the University of Hawaii she worked as a stand-up comic at the Comedy Store: but when her punchlines punched back, Stacy found herself happiest when making what New Yorkers called 'Performance'.            
       
Her present body of work is interdisciplinary in scope and includes live art, film, installation and visual art. Her work is as complex as it is accessible; humorous as it is challenging; visual as it is literate.          
       
A workshop leader and mentor of international renown, Stacy Makishi opens her making processes to the public through workshops, open rehearsals and talks, alongside performances. (NB. on **Tuesday 20 November** <a href="http://www.divergencymcr.org" target="_blank">Divergency</a> hosts her live art workshop <a href="http://www.divergencymcr.org/current/event/nov2018" target="_blank">*Killing Time*</a> for artists of colour.)             
       
She has been awarded an ICA Attached Artist Award, a Millennium Fellowship Award, a Live Art Development Agency One to One Bursary, an Artsadmin Bursary, and the Franklin Furnace Award.

As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
