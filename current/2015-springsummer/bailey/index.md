*Presented by* Contact + Word of Warning *during* Flying Solo Festival 2015         
       
####In Brief      
Tales of paranoia, young love and ultra-violence in a spiralling odyssey of pitch-black humour and nightmarish prose. A prime slice of surrealist trash, an Americana death trip and a dizzying exorcism for a world convinced it is dying.

####More            
A savage, surreal, and apocalyptic blend of spoken word, storytelling, caustic humour and gutter philosophy with echoes of Lenny Bruce, William Burroughs, beat poetry and B-movies. A blood-soaked love letter to the depraved, the depressed and the death-obsessed.
