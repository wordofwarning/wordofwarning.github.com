####In Brief        
The Metropolitan Police call him a "Domestic Extremist". The NHS have described him as "highly disturbed", and labelled him with Borderline Personality Disorder. "A real and present threat to the safe running of our lawful business" is how E.ON described him at the Royal Courts of Justice.        
       
He prefers the term *"Mental"*.

####More       
After ten years of being an outlaw and inpatient, notorious artist-activist the vacuum cleaner (famed for hijacking the Starbucks logo, parodying the Olympic twitter account and causing a minor riot by giving away 100,000 one cent Euros of free money) presents an autobiographical performance told through his psychiatric records, police intelligence files and corporate injunctions — all collected through the Data Protection Act.            
               
*Mental* is James' first autobiographical show, contrasting official language(s) against poignant and darkly humorous personal recollections. Spanning 13 years of his adult life, the show describes his experiences of severe and debilitating mental illness, suicide, social isolation, stigma, and police and corporate surveillance because of his activism and art.              
               
*"Although the show is intense, many of the taboos within the show need to be talked about. For example, the high rates of suicide in men under 35, current undercover police operations and the length that big business will go to silence its critics."*             
            
Held in the intimate setting of a bedroom, a limited audience are invited to join him under an oversized duvet. Accompanied by an OHP and vinyl records, James provides a welcoming environment for you to explore his pertinent experiences of the dynamics of power.
