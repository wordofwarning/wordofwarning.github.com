**Works Ahead** is a new project, developed out of the old Method Lab and SeedFund schemes run with greenroom.  Started in 2012, it aims to offer very small supported work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the year's Emergency platform and/or other events. Support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work.    

Works Ahead took place in May 2012 at Contact, as a Contact Re:Con co-production and featured a night of performances and a night of interactions, featuring Lowri Evans, Gareth Cutter, Krissi Musiol, Julieann O'Malley, Angel Club (north), Small Acts, Fallen Wall Arts.  Have a look at the archive and gallery [here](/archive/2012-woah/index.html)    

Works Ahead 2013 took place 2/3 May 2013, once more at Contact and featured a night of work that moves with 70/40 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau and winner of the 2012 Turn Prize, Ellen Turne; and work that speaks, with Lena Simic, Fa√ßade Theatre and Wayne Steven Jackson.
