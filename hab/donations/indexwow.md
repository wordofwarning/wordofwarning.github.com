##Supporter of Warning!    
You can support us in a number of ways:    
**by [signing-up for the mailer](http://wordofwarning.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0d0b9e09079cc9204f77cb396&id=d72a36f1c2)**    

or    
**by coming along to shows**  
or    
**if you like what we do and you'd like to help us continue by [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E)**    
All donations, no matter how small, would be very welcome.  So if you've a lonely fiver going begging, then why not give it a good home? We will put it to very good use, after all, those interval treats don't cost nothing!    

I'm sure I don't need to preach about straitened times and the onus on the arts to prove its worth and to attract private giving.  70% of all private giving goes to London organisations... and if you don't have a building it gets all the harder.    

So to help us demonstrate we're 'doing our bit' click [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E) or drop a a couple of coins in collecting tin at one of our free events.     

**We'll send web donors an exclusive personalised laminate to say thanks!**
