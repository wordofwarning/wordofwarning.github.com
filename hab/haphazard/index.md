**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into all ages live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around the historic [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org)' building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a day for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!
        
**In [2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard)** we filled Z-arts to the brim with moving musical sculptures, a bouncy squeaky ping-pong dance and an underground labyrinth (only for the brave!) — **[2015](/archive/2015-spring/haphazard)** saw everything from quirky quoits to crotchety crochet, freaky food to a jungle jamboree, topped off with a dose of dotty dance and a plea to avenge the apiary (or save the bees!); to get a feel for it have a look at [2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard) + [2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard) images.       
        
Our **third Haphazard** takes over Z-arts on Saturday 20 February 2016, with audiences coming and going as they please between 12noon and 4pm… <br>**we now seek proposals from artists (by 5pm, Friday 8 January 2016):**          
         
**This is not live art for children but live art for all ages**, so work should have appeal for adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!). We have access to a variety of spaces — from black box to gallery to café (<a href="http://haphazard.posthaven.com/haphazard-2016-live-art-for-all-ages-call-for-artists" target="_blank">see our Space Info sheet</a>) — though the programme emphasis will be more on durational and 'come and go' work than traditional black-box shows.         
        
**We have a small budget and expect to pay up to £300 for smaller pieces/interventions, up to a max of £1,000 for one main 'focal' work:** to apply, please complete our online <a href="http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/haphazard-2016-proposal-form" target="_blank">application</a> + <a href="http://habarts.wufoo.eu/forms/hab-monitoring-form" target="_blank">monitoring</a> forms.        
          
Haphazard 2016 is presented by Word of Warning + Z-arts; produced by hÅb; supported using public funding by Arts Council England, funded by Manchester City Council + supported by Z-arts.
