Tonight, Sedated By A Brick will summon up the spirits of their alter-ego theatre company, Serrated By A Knife.    

*Is there anybody out there?*    

Unexpectedly, three icons of the seventies will answer their call and assume the mantle of Serrated By A Knife, presenting their dramatic rendition of seminal book/film classic, *The Shining*.    

A fevered dream, a paranoid trip or an inter-generational seance? Whatever way you see it, they are a company possessed.    

Sedated By A Brick are a Bristol-based performance company, producing high quality ‘quirk’ since 2009. They want to see what kind of experiences they can create when they put their minds and bodies together. They combine strong imagery and a mordant strain of humour to explore interrelations between often impossible characters and situations.
