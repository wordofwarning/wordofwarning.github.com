#### In Brief      
One woman's memories of the home where she grew up. Populated by stories of communism, war, merriment and family, she shapes a world from paper and picture as she seeks the father she has lost.

#### Who are they        
Two Destination Language make contemporary performance that's beautiful, arresting and accessible; sometimes it's called theatre, sometimes live art, sometimes dance theatre — Word of Warning most recently presented their Brexit-triggered [*Manpower*](/archive/2016-autumnwinter/2destlang) in 2016.                
         
Led by artists Katherina Radeva and Alister Lownie, their work explores questions of identity, belonging and culture; as a Bulgarian and a Scot working together, they use their own histories and experiences to explore these ideas.            
          
UK-based, they are currently **?** resident Company at Salisbury Arts Centre and **?** supported artists at The Point, Eastleigh.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
Please note that as not everyone who reserves tickets uses them, to make sure we have a full house we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right, but unfortunately we occasionally have to disappoint people so please arrive early. However, where possible, if you do miss out we will try to get you in to another show at The Lowry that evening.
