**'Poolside Emergency** is the younger scouse sibling of Emergency.  An occasional platform for live art and contemporary performance co-produced with and presented at the Bluecoat, Liverpool over the course of one day.    

In 2013 it will take place on **Saturday 13 April** and the call for proposals will open in **early January 2013, deadline 15 February**.  Details to follow here.

In the meantime have a look at the 2011 [event blog](http://poolside.posterous.com)
