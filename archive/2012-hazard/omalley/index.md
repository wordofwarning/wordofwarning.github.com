200 soldiers have completed their tours of duty but now find themselves in yet another unfamiliar territory.    

Left alone to fend for themselves,  the soldiers' new mission is to conquer and survive the urban landscape of Manchester. Coloured gold and unable to shift or move from their military pose, they look on unnoticed: unsung heroes.     

150 soldiers will be placed on the streets of Manchester to survive. The remaining 50 will been given refuge in the kind homes of people willing to look after them.    

*Let's hope they survive and return safely.*    

On the 12th October a search party will be sent out to rescue the survivors; to be exhibited as ultimate heroes of the City of Manchester on the 13th October 2012 as part of [emergency](http://emergencymcr.org)    

*How many will remain?*
