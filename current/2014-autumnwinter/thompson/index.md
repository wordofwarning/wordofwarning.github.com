*Presented by* The Lowry + Word of Warning      
       
####In Brief      
Glitter, chicken legs and a rice pudding piñata: Selina invites you to her own version of a midnight feast, a cross between the confessions made over coffee at weight watchers, and sloppy drunken story-telling over a 3am kebab. Sitting somewhere between story telling, stand up, live art and theatre, *Chewing the Fat* is a powerful portrayal of how we live with our bodies.
