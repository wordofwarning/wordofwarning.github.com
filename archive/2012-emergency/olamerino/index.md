A one-man performance, devised in collaboration with Lowri Jones and Keely Hawkins, using spoken word, projection and movement.    

*You've been waiting for the kettle to boil, your train to arrive, and your lunch to be served. I've been waiting for you. The passing of time and the harsh weather have troubled my thoughts and my body. For the first or the thousandth time, I've been waiting for you to wait with me. You don't have to stay for long, but without you, I'm not much.* 

Leo Olamerino is a theatre-based artist working primarily with artists collective, Fake|Simile. As a performance maker, Leo aims to provoke stories rather than telling them, by providing the audience with material that aims at triggering our 'collective imagination' and regularly collaborates with established as well as emerging companies and artists.
