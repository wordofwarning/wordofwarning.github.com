#### About         
Emergency is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance — showing around 30 short works over a day/evening in Manchester each autumn. The upcoming 21st event 

Takes place in its 7th home, the brand new Contact and will necessarily be somewhat different… so new that this will be the first sneak preview audiences get! 

Small, booked audiences will be guided on a one-way journey through the building in timed slots, pausing en route in gallery fashion. We’re looking for approximately 10 works to fit these conditions, with an estimated audience journey time of 75 minutes.

*NB: this event is subject to local restrictions in Manchester.*
