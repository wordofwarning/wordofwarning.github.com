**Frances-Kay | Scaffold**    
Previously seen at this year's ['Poolside Emergency](/archive/2013-poolside/durationala) Frances-Kay's first installation, *Scaffold*, is inspired by her interest the impact of duration on the body and mind. It embodies her explorations of the body,
mind, and interests in religion and feminism; it represents her excitement of performing on high structures and the slight possibility of danger.    

Once again, a big thank you to CH + LJ, and this time FC + DW too.

**Will Dickie | Long Distance Relationship**    
A one-to-one performance in a public space. A meditative exploration
of togetherness and separation. An appreciation of the other as a
figure in dialogue with the background that surrounds it.    
*Take a cassette, stand on this spot, look out at the landscape, and wait.*    
Will Dickie is a performance-maker based in the suburbs of London
whose practice is supported by a long-term commitment to training and
self development, which includes Martial Arts, Butoh Dance and the
Suzuki Actor Training Method. As a performer his work spans theatre,
dance, and interdisciplinary collaboration, including extensive work
with Tadashi Endo, Diego Ferrari, Jo Shapland and Zecora Ura.    

He made his first solo performance work, *Memories of Suburbia*, in
2012 with an awarded bursary from Chisenhale Dance Space. He is now
artist in residence at Battersea Arts Centre where he is developing
his second solo, *Man in Helmet in the Landscape*. Both pieces are
inspired by interviewing those close to him and dancing alone in
public space.
