####In Brief                      
In life, as on stage, Lindsay knows the importance of the grand entrance and the dramatic exit… but is everything in the middle just a show? And who, exactly, is she playing?

####More       
Addressing the theory regarding identity and validation, with an individual journey documenting the life of an actress as she looks for the real person she is supposed to be playing. Having established a theatrical entrance she knows the importance of the dramatic ending — everything in the middle is just a show.       
      
####Who is she?    
Lindsay is an actress and artist based in the north west, with a spectrum of performance diversity and history in Black Light Puppetry, Burlesque, theatre and screen acting. Her work is largely based on autobiographical experience and has been recognised in her approach to the cinematic and burlesquian aesthetic. *Exit Smiling* is her second solo show, having performed *6:41pm Mercury Complex* for [Emergency 2013](/archive/2013-emergency/z2).
