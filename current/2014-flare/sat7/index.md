**Marius Mensink (Netherlands) | *Mick Jagger is my Nightmare***
**Walk of Shame (Norway) | *I Saw the Sign (Oooo is enough enough)***              
Prepare yourself for a night in the woods, the last day on Earth, the last hour before closing time in a bar. Don’t be shy. IT'S A PARTY. Sometimes, the sounds you hear are not what they seem. The space around you is your personal space. Party snacks will be provided.                      
                  
WALK OF SHAME is a group of artists with a background in theatre studies at the University of Bergen, Norway, the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki, the Art School in Bergen and the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies in Giessen, Germany; works include *Aint nobody home over there*, *Last Christmas*, *Waiting for Magic*, *Back to Basics vs. 1* and *Back to Basics vs. 2*. The group works at the interface between Apollonian and Dionysian energies and the dichotomy of nature/culture. *I Saw the Sign (Oooo is enough enough)* is the group’s sixth project, and operates in a landscape of comfortable interactivity, equality of means and the dramaturgy of the space.                
                  
**Almost Human (Netherlands/UK) | *A Grindhouse Dante***                     
A 'live film' of Dante Alighieri's *Inferno*; using DIY film-making machines, naked Barbie dolls and Action Men, botched special effects, and overweight performers in green morph suits, *A Grindhouse Dante* takes you on a cinematic rollercoaster — culminating in a bizarre and frantic choreography of shambolic puppetry. Featuring a performer-powered pedestal which rotates the camera, green screen and 360° lighting, the film is created through the manipulation of objects in front of the camera as it turns. Join them on a journey seen through Dante’s eyes, as we travel through hell’s unsettling and strangely beautiful bleak landscape.                   
                       
Almost Human is an international performance/experimental theatre group whose members are interested in making inventive and stimulating work through the use of technology and challenging scenographic practices. Their work intertwines the technical with the living, moving between digital and live space in real time to create performance that exists somewhere in between film, theatre and installation.
