#### What people have said about Works Ahead        
>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless …make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*         
<a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave (2016 review)</a>            
>• *Great to see new work by younger artists.<br>• Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.<br>• I enjoyed both shows even though they were very different. I look forward to seeing how they develop.*
