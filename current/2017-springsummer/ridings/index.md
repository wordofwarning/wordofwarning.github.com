#### What people have said about *The Road…*         
>*An inspired, deeply political essay rounded off by heartfelt empathy.*<br><a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720700401872412673" target="_blank">Alex Ballinger</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ambhack/status/720680046999023616" target="_blank">Oxfordshire Guardian</a>          
>*…a bombastic, dynamic explanation of world affairs since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013.<br>I think that we're all broadly aware of the vast level of surveillance that the government subjects us to. The strength of AMtSB, however, is that their humour and simple, compelling performance presents the facts plainly and directly challenges any sense that this is something that we can simply ignore, or pretend does not apply to 'people like us'.*<br><a href="http://scan.lusu.co.uk/index.php/2016/02/09/review-proto-type-theatre-a-machine-theyre-secretly" target="_blank">Student Comment And News</a>, Lancaster University
