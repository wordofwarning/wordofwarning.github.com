*I’m 24 and my world is really nice but there are lots of cracks. It’s like there’s been a tornado and loads of important bits have been blown away and broken. I remember being 4 and thinking everything was amazing, and I remember thinking that at 18 too. I’m afraid this piece is about being naive.*   

Alice Malseed is from Northern Ireland and lives in London. She makes performance with, for, and about, communities. Her work is honest, sometimes brutally so. Alice is currently studying MA Applied Drama at Goldsmiths.
