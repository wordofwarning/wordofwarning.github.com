Imagine a small, thin person stood in front of some other people whose heights and widths are variable.    
Imagine then that the small thin person is male and is a bit humpier and more stumbly than the other people.    
Imagine then that the small, thin, male, humpy, stumbly person opens his mouth and begins to talk about being small, thin, humpy and stumbly and you are some way to describing what this show is.    
Some way, but not very close.     

Dedicated to all those people who have dared speak to me over the years...    

Chris Fitzsimmons graduated from UCLAN in 2007 and has since written and performed in countless solo projects. He has been a member of the NYT since 2004 and continues to make work both solo and in collaboration with other artists.
