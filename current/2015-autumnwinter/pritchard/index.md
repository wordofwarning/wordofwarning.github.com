####More        
*Body of Light* is a very human journey into the world of technology. Take one finely tuned body, one home-gaming device and three creative minds, mix vigorously and see what happens. The result: a seamless landscape of flowing imagery, where the body's movements translate into sweeping brushstrokes, and the boundaries of flesh and pixel blur into one. Colour, texture and tone are shaped by body and in response, the body curves and moulds to the image, opening up new possibilities for human and machine alike.        
        
####Who is he?    
Darren Pritchard has been creating dance works since 2006. As well as devising his own works, for theatres, galleries, a church, hotels and even the *Sale of the Century* TV studio, Darren has created dance works for and in collaboration with others, notably *The Chase* — a Blaze commission, working with parkour and freerunning specialists; *Susan and Darren* — a Quarantine collaboration; *Gulliver's Boom Box* with Walk the Plank; and *One* — a solo performance installation. Most recently, he has worked as director on Chanje Kunda's award-winning *Amsterdam* and Cheryl Martin's *Alaska*.   
        
Stylistically, Darren has explored ballet, street dance and contemporary dance, sometimes fused with text, projection and other multimedia forms. This project takes him to a new level of technological innovation and has brought about an extraordinary new artistic partnership with Guernsey-based digital artist Marcel Normand and dancer Adam Russell, taking them from early steps in playing with Kinect (motion sensitive gaming technology) to being virtual experts in its manipulation.
