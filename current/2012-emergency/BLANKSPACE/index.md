Using a bed of earth, "the place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other", this piece explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.    

Kitty trained at Trinity Laban. During my time there I was lucky enough perform in work by Reinhild Hoffman, Zoi Dimitriou, Matteo Fargion and Marie-Gabriell Rotie, whose Butoh practice has been a great inspiration for this piece.

####aswespeakproject   *I know this, I do this all the time (I don't like it though)*    
*I do this again and again: I will close my eyes and keep still. You will draw. I will repeat your pattern until it becomes mine.  Could you also tell me what to wear?*      
  
This piece uses projection, direct audience participation and the performer's body to unearth the patterns that shape the space of the self, the messages, codes and images that invade, embed and collude on our encounter with the other.

####Evans & Gaskell   *100 Deeds*    
A visual gathering of deeds to define feminism in the modern day	It is deeds that are needed, not words. We're just not sure what deeds they should be.    

100 years ago, a woman did something which was considered by everyone to be truly heroic/irrational/essential/extremist/empowering/detrimental.  When Emily Wilding Davison jumped in front of the King's horse, her action would go on to impact how a nation perceives feminism.    
 
We want to know what feminism means now, or perhaps what actions should happen next.  Come and tell us what you think and brand your own purple sash “ we will try to turn your words into deeds (100 of them).

These ear sphere sculptures are also a floating presence around the space you are encouraged to search for strangers' personal memories by looking into each ear hole. Shining a torch from behind creates a light-box effect, the inside illuminated as if another's secret memory just came to you.

Coloured gold and unable to shift or move from their military pose, they look on unnoticed: unsung heroes.

####Clare Charnley	   *Nail Bar*    
A place to discuss ideas while you have a manual worker's finger nail fitted - fake false finger nails painted to look soiled, split, bruised or generally affected by manual work.

####Alice Malseed  *At the time, I had no idea...*    
I’m 24 and my world is really nice but there are lots of cracks. It’s like there’s been a tornado and loads of important bits have been blown away and broken. I remember being 4 and thinking everything was amazing, and I remember thinking that at 18 too. I’m afraid this piece is about being naive.
