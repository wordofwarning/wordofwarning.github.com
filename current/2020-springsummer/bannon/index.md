Soft flesh contends with hard metal as vibrating bodies + hysterical voices attempt to unseat the hidden interior of anxiety, desire, exertion, sexuality + relentless penetration.

#### More         
Three bodies are working hard — using an assortment of domestic objects with a choreography of subtle shaking and relentless labour to produce moments of operatic melodrama and brooding states of dissent, quaking + eruption.        
        
>'What is the role or necessity of pain in personal and social change? And who pays the price?'        
        
A striking, subtle dance piece, *We Are Fucked* uncovers the hard work it sometimes takes to live in a world which is not designed for you. Ecstatic and excruciating, euphoric and unforgiving — it's also quite sexy.  
          
*WAF* premiered in August 2018 at Arnolfini, prior to performances in September 2018 at Southbank Centre's Unlimited Festival.         
         
#### Who is she?        
Jo Bannon returns after 2017's [*Alba* — her story of paleness, blending in, and standing out](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/bannon) — and for *We Are Fucked* is joined by Louise Ahl + Rosana Cade.                   
        
A Bristol-based artist working in performance, choreography + live art, Jo also works as a dramaturg, educator + writer, and is a founder member of artist collective Residence. She has presented work in the UK, Europe, South America, USA, China, South Korea + Australia — Word of Warning presented her intimate [*Exposure*](/archive/2013-domestic/bannon) during 2013's Domestic. 
         
Jo's work is concerned with sensory perception and human encounter — exploring how our physical bodies experience the world around us, and how this sensory experience can or cannot be conveyed. Informed by her identity as a disabled woman with albinism, her work attempts to unpick the ways we look, hear, and sense our immediate environment — in order to rethink or make unfamiliar these intrinsic human behaviours. Her performances often manifest as intimate encounters designed for single or small audiences (e.g. *Exposure*), alongside staged theatre work and installations.
