**Emergency** our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance, is celebrating its sweet sixteenth birthday!  To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2014 [programme](/archive/2014-emergency) and [gallery](/galleries/2014-emergency).  In 2015 the sixteenth Emergency takes place on **Saturday 3 October**, at [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here), Manchester (12-10pm) with the callout for proposals open from Monday 13 July to **Friday 14 August, 5pm** — click [here](http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com) for full details.    

With a whole range of spaces to fill — what we now need is a lots of great work! So…      
Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works in progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event. Proposals are also encouraged for durational, one to one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces.    

**Emergency is:**    
• a free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).     
  
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be 20 minutes max in duration, low tech and suitable for quick turnarounds, self-supporting in terms of props/set/equipment and specialised technology.      

We also strongly encourage durational, one to one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces.    

Emergency will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses.
