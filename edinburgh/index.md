**Weekly Warning — Edinburgh Festivals 2018 Edit**        
Please be aware that this is very much my pick, largely from paper – so don't hold it against me! Please forgive things I've missed and note I don't focus on internationals as they're beyond WoW's programming paygrade! Final tips – please check dates carefully as you don't want to fall prey to random days off – and my main tip is to log-in to EdFringe, and use the favourites facility (you can then export them as a handy spreadsheet and sort it as you please – it's the only thing that keeps me halfway sane!) All that said I've not fully planned my strategy – it could well be an exhausting there and back for Live Art Bistro's overnight odyssey!
