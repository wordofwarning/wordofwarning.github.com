### Friday 3 + Saturday 4 June 2016        
**Different stages, different scales, still Works Ahead…**          
Two very different double bills make up our annual sampler of what's next in contemporary performance and live art — pushing the boundaries of form and content. [Autumn 2015](/archive/2015-autumnwinter) saw Word of Warning show over 40 emerging performances in spaces ranging from a building site to a theatre… From this enormous variety of work we have invited four artists at different stages in their careers to further develop their shows for Works Ahead 2016. They're all at the very beginning of their explorations…        
        
**Compact Edition, 5pm + 6pm. £4/2** (*limited capacity, repeats*)        
***Two extra shows added due to demand: 4pm (both dates)***           
Hidden stories and half-remembered truths from [Terri Donovan](/current/2016-worksahead/donovan) + [Afreena Islam](/current/2016-worksahead/islam).        
         
**Evening Edition, 7.30pm. £6/3**          
From Dyson to the Passion — an unpredictable double bill from [Top Joe](/current/2016-worksahead/topjoe) + [Lucy McCormick](/current/2016-worksahead/mccormick).

### Artists        
**Terri Donovan (Compact Edition, first part)**           
"*Finding Elsie* is about me, my Dad, my Gran… and dementia. This is my exploration of how relationships change and continue to change in my attempt to find a true reflection of my Elsie."            
          
**Afreena Islam (Compact Edition, second part)**          
"When I was little, I used to hang out at my dad's restaurant most weekends, back when they used to stay open until 5am. After a hard days toil running round like I owned the place I would fall asleep to the CCTV, my body on the chest freezer and my head resting on a pile of tablecloths."             
          
*Daughters of the Curry Revolution* is an exploration into her dad's life; from his journey to this country, to his journey to this day.           
           
**Top Joe (Evening Edition, first part)**             
Top Joe is a timid character who wears a hi-vis jacket and only comes out at night. He occasionally braves leaving the house in order to meet people and give his thoughts on life, vouchers and pistachios.             
          
For Works Ahead he is developing a piece that explores the nature of Ross Kemp, Dyson vacuum cleaners, identity, comedy, and childhood.        
          
**Lucy McCormick (Evening Edition, second part)**         
Post-popular prodigy Lucy McCormick and her Girl Squad present a trashstep-dubpunk morality play for the modern age. Casting herself in all the main roles, Lucy will attempt to re-connect to her own moral conscience by re-enacting old biblical stories via a nu-wave holy trinity of dance, power ballads and performance art. With trademark absurdism and enthusiasm, Lucy puts her best foot forward in the face of existential deadlock.
