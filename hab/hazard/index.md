**Hazard** is our biennial micro-festival of sited intervention, taking place in Manchester City Centre; since 2007 it has seen over 80 incursions into a normal Saturday in the City — ranging from wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 6km of Hazard tape to a wheelchair moon-landing.         
          
Normally taking place in July in ‘even’ years, our [fifth Hazard](/current/2014-hazard) takes place on Saturday 12 July 2014 across Manchester City Centre. To get a feel for it see 2012’s [programme](/archive/2012-hazard) + [image gallery](/galleries/2012-hazard), or our [event blog](http://hazardmcr.posthaven.com) to find vimeo footage from 2010 + 2008.
