A season of contrasts, from the eclectic explosion of our fourteenth [**Emergency**](/current/2013-emergency/index.html) to the intimate intensity of [**Domestic**](/current/2013-domestic/index.html), by way of [**Cinderella**](/current/2013-autumnwinter/rashdash/index.html) and [**The Sopranos**](/current/2013-autumnwinter/makishi/index.html)...

This season, alongside our regular outings to Z-arts and Contact, we will make our final visit to the lovely BLANKSPACE and will be venturing into new territory with a sited mini-festival in a Hulme block of flats.  

Talk about taking your work home with you, Cooper House just happens to be the abode of one of our number and we will be doing shows in the flat that was actually the birthplace of Word of Warning's parent company [**hÅb**](/hab/index.html).  [**Domestic**](/current/2013-domestic/index.html). Currently in the middle of a major refurbishment, Cooper House will play host to a series of stories and experiences for small audiences from the vacuum cleaner, Leentje Van de Cruys, J.Fergus Evans, Greg Wohead, Small Acts, Jo Bannon and (former Cooper House resident) Alex Bradley. All shows are VERY limited capacity so book early.    

Really hoping to see you at some of the forthcoming programme.  If you want to check out what you missed last season, have a look at the [Spring/Summer 2013 archive](/archive/2013-springsummer/index.html).    
 
####What is Word of Warning and where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of live performance: an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester.

We take live work very seriously – but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. In 2012, alongside funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Third Angel, Ellie Harrison, GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN, Levantes Dance Theatre, Action Hero, Richard DeDomenici, Made In China and many more, we served the audience gin and satsuma jello shots, played bingo, apple-bobbing, drenched them in confetti and reinvented St Andrews Day with snowballs and whisky macs.

####Who’s it for?
**Anyone looking for a different night out**.    

We don’t want to put you off by talking labels – yes there’ll be theatre, live art, dance – but the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening – there’ll be something you might want to take a chance on.

####Who is Word of Warning?
My name’s Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called [hÅb](/hab/index.html), which was greenroom’s partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events – like **Emergency** (Manchester’s free marathon of live work with 40 shows in 3 venues) and **Hazard** (random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).

I’ve been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I’ve been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon Hallelujah chorus!    

On the less eccentric side over the years, hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young north west artists to help them create new pieces of theatre and dance.
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at info@habarts.org             

I’m joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom’s long time programme coordinator. Often spotted in a hat or proffering a variety of bizarre refreshments, John is the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events.
