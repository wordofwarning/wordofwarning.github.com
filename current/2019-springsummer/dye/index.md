#### More         
*"Hey Baby! Welcome to a world of knee socks, bunches, lollypops, bubble gum, and models adopting the childlike expressions of six-year-old girls. A daring exploration into the paradox of living in a society that continues to infantilise women. Paedophilia is not ok yet fetishised images of women as pre-pubescent girls are. In this brave and outlandish performance a grown woman attempts to be your baby to discover if innocence really is as sexy as we're told it is."*

#### <a href="http://thelowry.com/about-us/festivals-projects/take-a-risk/wtf-wednesday" target="_blank">WTF Wednesday</a> ticketing policy at The Lowry         
As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
