#### More         
Harry Clayton-Wright explores how we learn about sex and how it shapes our lives — blending a no-holds-barred interview with his mum, startling performance, moving storytelling, and some good old-fashioned gay porn that his dad bought for him when he was 14.           
        
Delivered with the candour, positivity, and charm that have made him an acclaimed international touring success (*Briefs: Close Encounters*), Harry delves into his sexual past live on stage — the good, the bad, and everything in between. *Sex Education* is a show for anyone who's wondered why they want what they want.        
         
#### Who is he?        
Harry  is? Brighton Fringe Award winner (2017). Total Theatre Award nominee (2019).
