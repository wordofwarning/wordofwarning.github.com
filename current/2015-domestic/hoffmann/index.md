*Part of* Domestic II, *presented by* Word of Warning + The Guinness Partnership.      
         
####In Brief                      
A new solo show exploring the personal and shared experiences of growing up as one of the ‘feral underclass’ in relation to today's 'Austerity Britain'. 
Fleas, cheap clothes, thrifty bread, cold baths, and debauched disadvantaged dancing will be investigated as I chart the drive for survival and fitting in.    

Stories and songs about how to get by and make do will be shared whilst I attempt to overcome the shame of bareness and celebrate our spirit of community and hope.

####Who is she?    
Catherine Hoffmann explores the intersection between performance art, theatre, comedy and music. She combines process- based actions, texts, visuals and extended use of the voice in a number of solo and collaborative projects.   

Described as an elemental weather system, she creates a mixture of interactive one to one performances as well as staged pieces. She toys with personas and atmospheres that expose vulnerability, power and assumptions about identity and performance itself. She is concerned with exposing psychological fragility and personal rituals to address complex issues relating to who we are and the constraints in our contemporary lives with absurd humour playing an important role. Love, loss, guilt and shame are themes she has been exploring recently. Her own experiences and those of others. Personal Family history, current states and memories are exposed within this process.    

Recently she has made work for The Festival of Love at The Southbank, Latitude, In Between Time, Sprint festival at CPT, The National Portrait Gallery,  markets, buses, gardens, fields, bars and boxes in the UK and Europe. In October she will be performing in Love Letters to a (post) Europe in BIOS, Athens. She presents work with Home Live Art, and performs with Dickie Beau as part of The House of Strange Loops and with Lundahl and Seitl.  Her video TRAMP part of Molly and Me was selected for the Re.act Feminism 2 archive tour of European galleries in 2014-15.

>*Lovely…Hoffmann’s work evokes the joy of effacing oneself; of escaping the self into something bigger and more lasting than all of us.* — Time Out
