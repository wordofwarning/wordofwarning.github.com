From meditations on mortality to a life-affirming floral tribute, by way of canine beauty pageants and a dose of gallows humour. A season of choice…    
         
In Spring 2014 you'll mainly find us ensconced in Contact, starting with the return of [Proto-type Theater](/archive/2014-spring/prototype) in their operatic and lushly visual take on Camus’s *L’Etranger*, followed by a series of highly varied one-handers as part of **Flying Solo Festival 2014** — from [Rachel Mars](/archive/2014-spring/mars)’s take on the stand-up experience to the marvellous [Victoria Melody](/archive/2014-spring/melody) being upstaged by her scene-stealing basset hound.       
         
[Two Destination Language](/archive/2014-spring/2destlang) (Katherina Radeva + Alister Lownie) return to Word of Warning, filling the stage with hundreds of flowers in what one of my advisors described as one of the best shows they’d ever seen; we also see the third outing for **[Turn](/current/2014-turn)** at Contact. 
      
We're genuinely excited to be trying out a brand new space — the newly equipped STUN Studio at Z-arts — with a [double bill on ageing](/archive/2014-spring/age) featuring Manchester’s own Nicki Hobday + Sara Cocker and Forest Fringe’s Ira Brand.             
              
After Easter we head into a [Spring/Summer](/current/2014-springsummer) extension, with the third **[Works Ahead](/current/2014-worksahead)**, the second **[Flare Weekender](/current/2014-flare)**, and the fifth **[Hazard](/current/2014-hazard)** takes Manchester city centre by surprise with more random sprees of eccentricity.             
                
Really hoping to see you at some of our forthcoming programme; if you want to check out what happened last season, have a look at our [A/W 2013 archive](/archive/2013-autumnwinter).    
        
####What is Word of Warning and where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of live performance: an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester.

We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. In 2012, alongside funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Third Angel, Ellie Harrison, GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN, Levantes Dance Theatre, Action Hero, Richard DeDomenici, Made In China and many more, we served the audience gin and satsum
