**Emergency**, *our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance, is legally allowed to drive this autumn!*          
           
Our **seventeenth Emergency** takes place on **Saturday 1 October 2016** at [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here), Manchester (12noon-10pm), with the callout for proposals open until **Friday 19 August, 5pm** — click [here](http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com) for full details.             
         
With a whole range of spaces to fill — what we now need is a lots of great work!         
So… Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event. Proposals are also encouraged for durational, one-to-one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces available.       
               
**Emergency is:**    
• a free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).     
          
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be 20 minutes max in duration, low tech and suitable for quick turnarounds, self-supporting in terms of props/set/equipment and specialised technology.        
          
Emergency 2016 will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses.
