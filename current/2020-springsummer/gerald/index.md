#### More         
Jamal grew up Catholic in a Caribbean household, but would rather light a candle and worship celebrities than white saints.        
        
Combining African diasporic ritual, music + storytelling, *Idol* is a spiritual journey that asks what happens when you don't see yourself represented. Featuring a host of celebrity appearances.         
          
*Idol* premiered at Transform 19 in Leeds.        
         
#### Who is he?        
Jamal Gerald is a Leeds-based artist whose work is conversational, socially conscious, a celebration of individuality, and focuses on identity + lived experiences — mostly making the type of work that he wants to see, with the aim of taking up space as a Black queer person; trying to make sure that each piece he creates is a different form to the one he made before.

Jamal has made work for poetry slams, films, parties, cafes + theatres in many different forms — such as a solo show where he shares autobiographical stories about being Black + gay; to having one-to-one conversations about privilege; to stripping down to his underwear in the city centre of Leeds in a short film; to an interactive performance where he puts words in people's mouths…

Starting his career with the creative writing + performance group Leeds Young Authors, Jamal's first solo show *FADoubleGOT* toured nationally in 2016; he also co-devised + performed in the critically-acclaimed *Putting Words in Your Mouth*, devised + directed by Scottee, and his work has been shown at SPILL, Leeds Playhouse, Battersea Arts Centre + the Barbican.
