####Wayne Steven Jackson	   *(7,070,732,128) and two*    
A live performance trying to be a film, piecing together fragments of narrative, telling the story of two people meant to be more than strangers. After the opening credits fade you will see the man and the woman walk towards each other, strangers, oblivious to their imminent collision.  And you will fall in love with these mediated, fictional characters behind the screen, will them to see each other, to see into each other; to have their happy ending.    

But this time will be different.  This time you won't play by the rules.  This time you will be with them in that moment.  And this time, this time this story will be about you.    

Wayne Steven Jackson creates *'poignant, beautiful and clever'* work.  Fusing video and liveness he confronts the fleeting moments of performance and explores ideas of memory and of being.  Image created by Alana Danielle Richards.     

He has worked for eight years creating 'funny, baffling, mystical, absurd and mind bending' work with Escape Theatre, creating seven pieces of live performance both with Escape and as a solo artist.  Wayne is currently exploring the relationship between live performance and memory, using video within his performances with intelligence and creativity as an aide to exploring his and his audience's position to his work.

####Allan Taylor	*Success and the City*    
Allan is just another strong, successful person in control of his single and fabulous life.

A take on the cult classic *Sex and the City*,  Allan explores the ideals of modern city living through a staged TV episode where his interior monologue and perception of the world in his own psycho drama soon goes awry after he comes to a realisation about the world he has constructed.    

Allan Taylor is a live artist, writer and theatre-maker whose work ranges from theatrical performance to durational installations and intimate performances. His work investigates the absurd in relation to the self and how external expectations affect our internal self-perception, often using character and façade to display the dichotomy between our ideals and reality.

Some way, but not very close. :)
