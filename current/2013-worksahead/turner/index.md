*Winner* Turn Prize 2012.      
       
####In Brief    
*Ever had the urge to jump off a train platform? To slap a random stranger? Or to open the car-door on the motorway?*        
        
We all naturally have impulsive thoughts and through our upbringing in modern day society, we know that to "act" on our impulses could be frowned upon. We have learnt how to hide, ignore and suppress these impulsive urges ... up until now.    
       
####More    
*Car-Door Moment*, with its playful charisma, will open its arms and embrace all weird, hilarious and outrageous impulsive moments. Ellen Turner will go where no one dares to go, and experience life without consequences in a mischievous "tongue-in-cheek" physical dance work that celebrates our most instinctive and impulsive reactions to life.    

Ellen Turner — a young, energetic dance artist twitching with energy — brings you *Car-Door Moment*: a journey of her most common and honest impulsive thoughts.        
        
####Who is she?    
Ellen Turner is a northern-based dancer and choreographer from Lancaster, who trained at The Northern School of Contemporary Dance. She started her career by joining Ludus dance company and toured work by Dylan Quinn, Yael Flexer, Ben Wright and Nigel Charnock. She has gone on to work with Maelstrom Dance Company, Brightfurnace Dance Company, and 12 Degrees North. She has also worked with Gary Clarke and Genevieve Say on her most recent work *5ive.*    
        
For the past year and half, Ellen has been perusing her choreographic aspirations by creating her newest work *Car-Door Moment* which won the Turn Prize 2012. She enjoys creating and performing high-energy work, which pushes audiences expectations of dance, whilst creating an entertaining atmosphere.
