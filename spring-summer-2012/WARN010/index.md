####In Brief
A journey around the hidden spaces of a theatre - one monumental installation, three intimate encounters... 

####Who Are They?


####More
October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-long "maze of performance": [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/).  Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing emergency accommodation artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
