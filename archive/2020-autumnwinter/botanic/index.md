#### Programme         
Chanje Kunda · *Masking Climate Change*<br>&nbsp;Masking our faces, our expressions, our emotions — the new sea of blue is masking the harm we do to our world. Disposable plastics and masks are clogging the environment, destroying the beauty that should be healing.<br>&nbsp;From the maker of *Plant Fetish*, this new twist juxtaposes the beauty of nature and the blight of trash to ask if there's a botanical remedy to our ills.        
        
Christian Asare · *Seen/Heard/Scene/Herd*<br>&nbsp;Visual Art and spoken word…<br>&nbsp;A Scene for the Herd. A Scene that is Heard.<br>&nbsp;A Herd much less Seen. Often Seen, never Heard.        
        
Jade Williams · *Pablo Fanque's Fantastic Fair*<br>&nbsp;For the benefit of our forgotten Black Britons, come and rejoice in the might of the fair.<br>&nbsp;Jade is a mover, writer + performer.        
        
Jamil Keating · *The Crown*<br>&nbsp;Corona — a crown; the gaseous glow around the sun; a virus.<br>&nbsp;A conversation of witches and wizards, peace and love, Hypatia, Joan of Arc, of people, pain + democracy. A casting of the runes for our chaotic times by Jamil E.R Keating + others.        
        
Maya Chowdrhry · *Seeds on Earth*<br>&nbsp;Maya poetically asks you to plant seeds — to counter climate change; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioremediation" target="_blank">bioremediate</a> for soil pollution; and to consider what seeds we need to feed ourselves.<br>&nbsp;A live artist and poet, Maya creates immersive and democratic experiences for audiences that explore seed sovereignty and food justice.        
        
Shkiesha · *Mindful*<br>&nbsp;Is Mindful a mind full? Is empathy empty? What is the tempo of your temper?<br>&nbsp;Observe the rhythm of your heart beat. Fall into synchronicity with the river.<br>&nbsp;A movement piece by physical performer and conceptual artist Shkiesha Asantewa.
