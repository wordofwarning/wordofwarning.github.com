####Who Are They?

Jack Coverdale is the founder/director of Fallen Wall, a contemporary arts company, specialising in performance work and based in Preston, UK.  Interested in the live-ness of performance and what distinguishes it from television and film, the work is never polished, high-tech or big budget and strives to expose artifice instead.    

Jack is obsessed with failure; and couldn’t escape it if he tried.    

####More

*I am in love with you.     
So in love it hurts.    
Do you love me like I love you; like in the films?    
I need you.    
I cannot be without you.   
I will follow you; to venice, to the top of the eiffel tower.   
I will hold you in my arms, in the rain and the moonlight and we will kiss for the last time.*

####Works Ahead: Interactions

A journey around the hidden spaces of a theatre - one monumental installation, three intimate encounters... 

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-long *maze of performance*: [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/).  Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing emergency accommodation artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
