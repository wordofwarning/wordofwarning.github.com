#### In Brief      
For those moments – between coffee and dancing – when harmony abandons us and all that's left is the desire to scream.

#### Who are they?        
Igor Urzelai and Moreno Solinas are two London-based dance artists. They started creating stage works collaboratively in 2007, co-founding ‘BLOOM! dance collective’ in 2009 and ‘Igor and Moreno’ in 2012.         
        
Igor and Moreno make work about people and what makes us such special animals. Their work is characterised by their interest in the moving body and the immediacy of action as a vehicle for meaning, ideas and desires.         
         
Across all their works they have always tried to create a frame to share their views without dictating a single reading, instead creating space for reflection for the viewer. They want to reclaim the role of the theatre as a place for assembly and exploring the cathartic properties of live performance.           
          
Currently Work Place artists (the associate artist programme at The Place), Igor and Moreno have presented their works extensively in Europe and the USA with recognition from both audiences and professionals: in 2010 they won the Rudolf Laban Award and special mention at Prix Jardin d'Europe; they were an Aerowaves Priority company in 2011, 2013 + 2015; in 2015 they were nominated for the National Dance Awards 2015, Total Theatre Awards 2015 and selected for the British Council Showcase 2015, Anticorpi XL network + Vetrina Giovane Danza D'Autore.        
          
#### What people have said about *A Room for…*         
>*The depth and range of emotions that this singular piece provokes within me is astounding.*<br><a href="http://www.jakeorr.co.uk/blog/2015/10/being-gay-and-finding-hope-in-dance-igor-and-morenos-a-room-for-all-our-tomorrows" target="_blank">Jake Orr</a>           
>*…probably sent everyone home infused with a greater degree of humorous compassion for their own relationships. It was a pure, unadulterated delight.*<br><a href="http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/watch-out" target="_blank">Joy Martin, Exeunt</a>           
>*…it was BRILLIANT. And VISCERAL. […] You know the best thing about 'visceral'? IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN ANYTHING You just feel it.*<br><a href="http://synonymsforchurlish.tumblr.com/post/130642370648/stimulants-mate-igor-and-moreno-not-even" target="_blank">Megan Vaughan</a>          
>*The tension between the two dancers was extraordinary and overwhelmingly human. […] Every aspect of this performance was executed to perfection. I can't wait to see what these two produce next.*<br><a href="http://dulciefraserdance.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/igor-and-moreno-a-room-for-all-our-tomorrows" target="_blank">Dulcie Fraser</a>
