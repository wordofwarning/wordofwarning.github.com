#### In Brief
A day out for the curious of all ages.    

Intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted around this historic building - take a wander and see what you stumble upon... living geometric shapes making moon music, a bonkers bucket dance, marathon hula-hooping and bouncy, squeaky, ping-pong performersâ€¦ playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft.   

Check back here soon as we are still confirming artists!
