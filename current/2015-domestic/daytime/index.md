**Threshold ¦ *1989 called...***      
A sonic silhouette, an artist's self-portrait created from the substance of absence.    
*1989 Called...* shapes a sonic silhouette, an artist's portrait in their absence created from the substance left behind that might define them. In this case, the portrait is created from genuine answer phone messages left by friends, recorded in 1989. We listen in on someone else's life as disembodied voices from the past hint at relationships, events, both real and imagined, and imply a character to this absent recipient for whom the messages were once intended.

**Mackenzie & Reed ¦ *Natura Naturans***             
Natura Naturans redefines ‘life’ to ask, is a space ever really uninhabited?    
Acting as enablers, Mackenzie and Reed explore the flaws in our current definition of the word ‘life’ by allowing the activity of living matter within the room to become performer.  Using a combination of live microscopy, projection and sound recording within the seemingly uninhabited domestic space, the artists will reveal that the room is alive and coax it into a collaborative performance, encouraging reflection on what constitutes ‘life’ and of our co-existence with this unassuming other.

A brief encounter with a stranger about the bits of life you'd like to never forget.  A conversation for one person at a time.    

It’s a short story, a snapshot of the everyday.  You are invited to celebrate the things that matter to you, to commemorate the small things, the bits of life which you’d like to remember.    

What is your 4th July? Whose birthday would you never forget? When did you take your first steps?

Charlotte CHW is a multidisciplinary artist based in Hastings primarily working in the realms of live art, sculpture, sound and installation and where the boundaries of these mediums do or don’t lie.

**Afreena Islam ¦ *Daughters of the Curry Revolution***         
Not very authentic "Authentic Indian Cuisine".  A repeating performance for small groups.    
When I was little, I used to hang out at my dad's restaurant every weekend, back when they used to stay open until 5am. After a hard days toil running round like I owned the place for a bit, I would fall asleep to the CCTV; my body on the chest freezer, and my head resting on a pile of tablecloths.    

*The Daughters of the Curry Revolution* is a reflection on my dad's life; from his journey to this country, to his journey to this day.

**Ana Mendes ¦ *Backspace***             
An audio experience for one person at a time.
