**Mayhem on Merseyside — a day-long splash of live art and performance in Liverpool.**
       
Returning for its third frenetic outing, this mini-marathon of the weird and the wonderful, the bizarre and the breathtaking takes over at the Bluecoat.

Previously at 'Poolside: a hunting party leading a charge and visceral experiments with butter and treacle; slow-dances in the lifts and singing in the toilets; mermaids in the cupboards and bucket-dancing in the stairwells.

Drop-in for ten minutes or stay for the full five hours — a free day-out for the curious with twenty-five new works, featuring (subject to change):    

**Saturday 13 April, from 12noon to 5pm**
