####12.30-12.50pm | 2.30-2.50pm		
**Levantes Dance Theatre | *The Western Frontier* (work-in-progress)**        
A playful exploration of love in a western landscape or an adventure in love, loss and banjos… A return to Manchester for eccentrically engaging and offbeatly odd Word of Warning favourites, Levantes Dance Theatre.      
           
A work in development, commissioned by hÅb for Haphazard 2015.

####1-3pm | 2.50-3pm performance		
**Liz Clarke | *My Inflatable One***        
A cross between a rubbery, exploding 'sewing bee' and an odd cabaret. 
Part-mundane, part-spectacle, part-wonderment, this encounter charts the quest for *Bigger! Better! More!* through the medium of balloons and silly soundtracks.     
	
A performance-maker who blurs the boundaries between reality and dreamscape, Liz's shows include *I Tattooed My Baby* (she didn't) and *Cannonballista*, a dark human cannonball show (she did).
