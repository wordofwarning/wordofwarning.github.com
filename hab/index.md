### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer + strategic advocate of contemporary performance, live art + sited work in the North of England. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy — working in collaboration with a range of [venues + other partners](/hab/partners) to produce showing [opportunities](/hab/news), platforms + artist development projects like [Divergency](/hab/divergencymcr), [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Foot In The Door](/hab/footinthedoor), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), [Hazard](/hab/hazard) + [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).         
          
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with [artists, colleagues and venues](/hab/partners) to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish. A member of <a href="http://www.liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a> — a national network supporting + developing the UK's Live Art infrastructure for the benefit of artists, presenters + audiences — hÅb is supported using public funding by <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/NPO" target="_blank">Arts Council England</a>.          
        
Since January 2012, however hÅb gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/) — a peripatetic programme of, and regular bulletin for, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond. *N.B. this site aims to offer information to artists wanting to know more about our work and how to get involved; for more information about our public programme please see [Word of Warning](/).*       
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), an annual micro-festival for new live work (now in its nineteenth year) which presents about 20 short pieces in a day each autumn (and its former Merseyside sibling, ['Poolside Emergency](/hab/poolside)); through [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work (now in its seventh year) — we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance + live art.           
               
hÅb works as a curator of sited performance + intervention presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention, taking performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre (*tbc* next in July 2018), as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our more frequent foray into all ages live art with Z-arts (last in April 2017). We also co-produce [Turn](/hab/turn), a regular micro-festival for new northern dance + dance-makers (last in April 2017).           
         
In any given year, hÅb might work with 150 artists, present 2 platforms, 1 sited festival, and show over 60 pieces of work as [Word of Warning](/).
