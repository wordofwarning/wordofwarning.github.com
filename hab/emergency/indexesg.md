**Emergency StopGap is hÅb's newest event — a small informal platform for live art: to bridge the gap between gallery + theatre, and to fill the empty months of winter — is now OPEN for proposals.**            

**Emergency StopGap** takes place on **Thursday 27 February 2020 (6-10pm)** in Manchester's <a href="https://www.niamos.space" target="_blank">NIAMOS</a>, with the call for proposals open until **Friday 17 January, 5pm** — see full details <a href="http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">here</a>.          
         

Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals for durational, one to one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works.

Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable.

The event’s objectives are to be:
•	an informal Pay What You Decide public open submission platform;
•	an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer review work.

Spaces available (see Space Information below for details before proposing): 

NIAMOS is BIG, and complicated and we can’t begin to list all the spaces we might use! It’s also old, decayed and challenging – and is best looked at like a site! We apologise but physical access to the building is challenging – please ask for specifics if you have physical access needs and are considering making a proposal. 

It includes an auditorium with stalls and a stage (which we are imagining using for larger durational or installation work);  a Circle (which we imagine using for one-to-one conversational work and/or headphone based work); a range of alcoves and stairwells; plus a ‘foyer’ that can run as a café with the possibility of intervention and cabaret-esque work. The Space Information below outlines the main rooms, but there are other small areas – both open to passers-by and or closed for more intimate and one on one type work – which we might put work in.  If you are looking for a type of space not listed, please select “Other – public” or “Other – private” and describe the kind of space you want and we’ll see if anything fits!

For StopGap we are specifically looking for durational, one to one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces. Access to power and technology is limited in this site – work that can use domestic or battery powered technology is strongly encouraged.

With a whole range of spaces to fill — what we now need is a lots of great work! Artists working in live art and contemporary performance are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress, or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event.<br>For daytime work at NIAMOS we are looking for durational, performance installation, intervention and limited capacity and 1-2-1 work.<br>For evening work at Z-arts/STUN we are looking for short (20 min max) show-type work.       
               
To get a feel for it, have a look at the 2018 [programme](/archive/2018-emergency) + [gallery of images](/galleries/2018-emergency).                    
        
**Emergency StopGap is:**    
• a pay-what-you-decide, public micro-festival + open submission platform;        
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show, and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).      
          
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be: 20 minutes maximum in duration; low-tech or no-tech, and suitable for quick turnarounds; self-supporting in terms of props, set, equipment, and specialised technology.         
            
As this seems to be a recurrent question: whilst we don't encourage it, you are permitted to submit more than one proposal but it is unlikely that more than one would be successful from a single artist/group.           
            
**Please note:**          
• Emergency StopGap will feature around 10 pieces of work throughout the evening;        
• our technology resources are limited, please bear this in mind when making a proposal;         
• Emergency StopGap will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses.        
• There may be more resources available for a larger durational piece for the NIAMOS auditorium/stage area. Please get in touch to discuss.
