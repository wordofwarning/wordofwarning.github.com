#### More             
Autumn 2017: the bedroom tax, food banks and the shadow of Grenfell loom large over life below the breadline.           
         
In a kaleidoscopic picture of what it means today to be young, gifted and black… and poor… and gay… a group of Mancunian performers hark back to Harlem of the 1920s and party their way into the 2020s as a way of paying the rent.        
           
A joyously defiant stand against growing up poor. A 21st century, austerity Britain, black, gay, immersive musical in a real block of flats.        
       
Showing for just two nights in a Salford tower block, come along, then Pay What You Decide — if you haven’t got the cash, then food will do.†          
          
#### Who is he?        
Darren Pritchard has been creating dance works since 2006. As well as devising his own works, for theatres, galleries, a church, hotels and even the Sale of the Century TV studio, Darren has created dance works for and in collaboration with others, notably: *The Chase* — a Blaze commission, working with parkour and freerunning specialists; *Susan and Darren* — a Quarantine collaboration; *Gulliver's Boom Box* with Walk the Plank; *One* — a solo performance installation; and [*Body of Light*](/archive/2015-autumnwinter/pritchard) — a seamless landscape of flowing imagery that Word of Warning presented in 2015. Stylistically, Darren has explored ballet, street dance and contemporary dance, sometimes fused with text, projection and other multimedia forms, and has recently worked as director on Chanje Kunda's award-winning *Amsterdam* + Cheryl Martin's *Alaska*.
