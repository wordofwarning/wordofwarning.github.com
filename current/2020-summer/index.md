#### About         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy and introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond… including online.           
            
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that’s out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href=" http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
      
[We](/current/2020-summer/#who) take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all.<br>Over the past 8½ years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Amy Bell, Harry Clayton-Wright, Chanje Kunda, Stacy Makishi, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, and Proud & Loud Arts (amongst others).         
         
#### Audiences         
We don't want to put you off by talking art form labels (there will be theatre, live art, performance, dance, etc.) — our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced.<br>If you like comedy, music, gaming, or just want a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on… Here's what audiences have said:        
>*Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*
<br>*Brave, dark, humerous, intimate, intense.*
<br>*Heartwarming, funny + engaging.*
<br>*Strangely mesmeric. A unique experience.*
<br>*Always special, bringing the unexpected and intriguing, thank you.*
<br>*Fabulous for seeing things different from the mainstream machine.*
