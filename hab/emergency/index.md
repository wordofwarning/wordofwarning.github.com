**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, featuring at least 25 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester…             
             
Our **[fifteenth Emergency](/archive/2014-emergency)** took over the cavernous realms of [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here) on Saturday 4 October 2014, see some [images](/galleries/2014-emergency). For a glimpse of our previous performance lucky-dip see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-emergency) + [image gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).        
      
**Emergency is:**    
• a free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
• a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).
