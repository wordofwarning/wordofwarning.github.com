###Thursday 8 + Friday 9 May 2014, 7.30pm
Our annual sampler of what's next in contemporary performance and live art — pushing the boundaries of form and content. To date, Works Ahead has brushed the petticoats of dance, skirted the fringes of musical theatre and warped the lines of performance installation… 2014 sees three new works in development delving into the mindset of the performer.       
        
*The houselights dim, the audience goes quiet — and there you are… transfixed in a spotlight…*
