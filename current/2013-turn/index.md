So it's all over for another year... Manchester's 13th marathon of the bizarre, the beautiful and the bold popped up in three venues - BLANKSPACE, Castlefield Gallery and Z-arts and this year's Emergency featured a full 39 free pieces of live work.    

Daytime installations, interactions and intimate experiences at BLANKSPACE and Castlefield Gallery and an evening of sit-down performance at Z-arts.
