####More   
*Hunt & Darton Cafe are proud to satisfy appetites in more ways than one.*                   
                      
An award-winning pop-up cafe — which isn't just arty, it is ART. A fully functioning cafe that blends art with the everyday — a social and artistic hub where spontaneity and performance meet great food and drink.
                      
Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton expose the inner workings of their business by presenting everything as art — from the food served, the people serving, the décor and public display of their bank balance to the lovingly hand-picked charity shop crockery.
                      
*Hunt & Darton Cafe* encourages playful participation and meaningful social encounters — through its alternative service from its hosts Hunt & Darton in their iconic fruit or veggie attire, comic interaction through their "set menu" performances, guest waiters and themed days such as "You-Do-It" or "Health & Safety" day.             
                      
Popping up throughout March as the hub for Manchester's SICK! Festival, guest waiters include Pigeon Theatre, Nikki Hobday + Sara Cocker and Erini Kartsaki. There are new theme days responding to the festival themes such as ‘Sexy day' on which it will be encouraged to speak frankly about sex, the food is phallic and served up accompanied by sexual innuendos.

Hosted talks will approach the core themes of the festival collaborating with medical practitioners, academics, Artists and local groups. Imagine being served your tea whilst getting that leg looked at! Or perhaps you would like a bowl of Coco Pops served with a conversation about mental health.

Make sure you join us for Unhappy Hour to enjoy pre-show 2for1 drinks offers and great food. Just show us your ticket and you are in!

####Who are they?                
Hunt & Darton are a Live Art Collaboration between Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton. They have both practiced Art since graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2003 and been Working together for 7 years. Approaching Live Art from a Fine Art background we work across mediums with a sculptural approach to performance, choreographing words and movement in a sensory way and setting up alternative spaces – often creating installations to perform within. Our work derives from our shared celebrations and anxieties surrounding life choices particularly as women, in Britain, now. Our work has been described as deadpan and absurd, often collapsing into humour. We have a persistent fetish within our practice to consistently re-assess our relationship with our audience, embracing awkward moments, risk taking and constantly trying to close the gap between performer and viewer opting for a raw, underdone, conversational aesthetic.            
                      
Hunt & Darton are associate artists at Artsadmin + Cambridge Junction.
