*Adopt a plant and become part of an unusual family!*

Alexandra planted 30 vicia faba beans and raised them with unusual care and attention while documenting the whole process on video. Each plant is unique and has been fertilised with the artist's blood. Each one has its own identity. On 13 October 2012 all of Alexandra’s plants are up for adoption.    

Come to her greenhouse and become part of her bean family! Adopt a plant of your choice and you will find out how it's been raised exactly. After that, it's up to you… How will you take care of your vicia faba?    

Alexandra Kraszko is both a solo and collaborative artist, mainly experimenting within the fields of live art, installation, durational and one to one performance. Alexandra has recently been seen in Angel Club (north)’s performance installation *Minute*.
