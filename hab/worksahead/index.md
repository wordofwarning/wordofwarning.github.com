**Works Ahead** is a project developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes we ran with greenroom until 2011. Started in 2012, it aims to offer very small, supported, work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the previous year's [Emergency](/hab/emergency) platform and/or other events. Support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work…       
        
The **[first Works Ahead](/archive/2012-woah)** took place in May/June 2012, with a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production) featuring a night of performances from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans + Krissi Musiol; and an evening of interactions from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley + Small Acts… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
The **[second Works Ahead](/archive/2013-worksahead)** took place in May 2013, once more at Contact, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 Turn Prize*); and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre + Wayne Steven Jackson… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
The **[third Works Ahead](/archive/2014-worksahead)** took place in May 2014 at Contact, with a triple bill of work that delved into the mindset of the performer from Lindsay Bennett, Paul O'Donnell + SheepKnuckle… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2014-woah).        
        
Our **[fourth Works Ahead](/archive/2015-worksahead)** took place in April 2015 at Contact, with a double bill from Nathan Birkinshaw + Jamil Keating: two young male artists questioning manliness in this digitised, disembodied, discombobulated era… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2015-woah).          
           
Our **[fifth Works Ahead](/archive/2016-worksahead)** took place in June 2016 at Contact, with two very different double bills from four artists at different stages in their careers: Terri Donovan + Afreena Islam; Top Joe + Lucy McCormick. On different stages, at different scales… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2016-woah).             
          
Our **[sixth Works Ahead](/archive/2017-worksahead)** took place in May 2017 with two nights in two venues featuring three artists: Tom Cassani + Toni-Dee Paul's double bill at Contact, and Chanje Kunda at STUN Studio at Z-arts… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2017-woah).                 
                 
Our **[seventh Works Ahead](/archive/2018-worksahead)** took place in May 2018 at STUN Studio at Z-arts, with a double bill from Emma Geraghty + Vijay Patel: a girl and a guitar, a boy and a box of questions; two artists at the start of their journeys… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2018-woah). In 2018 we also seed-commissioned Jamal Gerald's new work *Idol* for development in partnership with Transform in Leeds.            
              
Our **[eighth Works Ahead](/archive/2019-worksahead)** took place in May 2019 at STUN Studio at Z-arts, with a double bill from Mark Croasdale + Avital Raz: two explorations of inner conflict, outer division, and the politics of oppression… See their [image gallery](/galleries/2019-woah).
