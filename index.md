#### We've decided not to host a [Domestic](/current/2021-domestic) event in May — based on the proposals received, we sense that artist's appetite for showing their work online from home is currently waning. Our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling call for proposals remains opens</a> so please feel free to suggest something — we'll put together an event later this year when we’ve got the right content. In the interim, look out for a new livestreamed event coming soon…<br>Discover new video performance in <a href="http://domesticatedonline.org" target="_blank">Domesticated</a> & re-watch livestreamed events on <a href="http://bit.ly/YTwarnmcr" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br><br>If you've seen one of our events or an online performance, please <a href="http://bit.ly/warnmcrfeedback" target="_blank">share your thoughts with us</a>.<br>Find more interesting things to watch and support information for artists on our [News](/news) page.
