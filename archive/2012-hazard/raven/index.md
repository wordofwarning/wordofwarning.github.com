Dressed up in tropical gear, and with an acoustic guitar, Simon Raven will become an itinerant busker, playing *Summer Holiday* and other songs around a vintage double-decker bus.  He will be giving the audience a penny to listen to him, subverting the usual transaction that takes place when busking.     

It is a comment on the idea of the stay-cation and the ironic act of going on a holiday from one city centre to another in a recession.      

Simon Raven makes concept-led performances that traverse the boundaries of what constitutes normal or constructive behaviour. Having been treated for depression, and diagnosed with hypomania, he is interested in advances in medicine, the social model of disability and its relationship to the arts.
