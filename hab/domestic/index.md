**2020's series of Domestic "at homes"** is an informal online platform for artists to beta test new work, live from their homes… What can you make when your kitchen table, bathroom, balcony, or garden tent is the stage — and your camera is the audience?        
         
We're interested in whatever you are interested in saying right now — our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">open call</a> seeks proposals from artists working in live art + contemporary performance for short (max 10 min) works that can be performed online within your available resources — next event is on **7 October**<sup>†</sup>*.
          
See live streams of our <a href="http://youtu.be/IUNv7CARKLU" target="_blank">pilot event from **1 July**</a> featuring six invited artists, and our <a href="http://youtu.be/AOT29ZTtZAA" target="_blank">second from **12 August**</a> with seven works selected from our open call.        
        
<sup>†</sup>*In the interests of full disclosure, we're aware that appetite for making work online is on the wane — so we're using this call out as a litmus test. We believe that this is only worth doing if we can do it well — so if the right work isn't there to make up a really good programme for 7 October, we might all be better served by not doing it! Equally, this call out will remain open on a rolling basis for future events.

#### *Domestic origins…*         
In 2013/15/17 we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…         
         
**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes… See the [image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).         
         
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/archive/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on a new block of flats, this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment — Matthias Court (M3 6JD) was a space in transition — using only the top (15th) + ground floors over 3 nights + a day to show 17 pieces by artists including Leo Burtin, Ria Hartley, Catherine Hoffman, Cheryl Martin, Michael Pinchbeck + Louise Wallwein… See a rapid overview <a href="http://vimeo.com/143630694" target="_blank">on vimeo</a> + the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic).        
        
**In November 2017, [*Rent Party: Domestic Edition*](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard)** popped up next door in Salford's Adelphi Court during its refurb… Part show, part party, Darren Pritchard Dance's joyously defiant stand against growing up poor is a 21st century, austerity Britain, black, gay, immersive musical — for those just about managing. See the [image gallery](/galleries/2017-domestic). Thanks to our generous audiences we donated £574.65 & four crates of food to Salford Foodbank.        
        
Domestics (2020) are presented by [Word of Warning](/) + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
