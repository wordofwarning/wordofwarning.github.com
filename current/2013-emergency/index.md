####Saturday 5 October 2013, 12noon-11pm             
**Manchester's marathon micro-festival**, [Emergency](/hab/emergency) returns for its fourteenth year — the bizarre, the bold and the beautiful popping up in a plethora of spaces.       
          
Last year we taped performers to windows, played a uniquely guttural rendition of Nessun Dorma and unearthed a viscerally prehistoric woman. This year will be an equally eclectic performance lucky-dip in two locations — your chance to sample the different and all for free.         

Drop-in for ten minutes or stay for the full eleven hours — a free day-out for the curious with over twenty-five new works; featuring artists (subject to change):
