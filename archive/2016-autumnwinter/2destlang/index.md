*Presented by* The Lowry + Word of Warning          
         
#### In Brief      
A DIY project. A DJ set. A celebration of everyday maleness.         
        
Set to the music of the forty years pre-Brexit, *Manpower* looks at the changing male roles that led to the cry 'we want our country back' and sets about reclaiming the little things: the right song, the right bolt for the job, the everyday pleasures of the working man… especially those that aren't working now.

#### More         
A man at work. A man playing. A man playing at being a man. A woman too.         
         
Alister and Kat have been thinking about men and power. Aspirations and expectations. Sheds and tea. Mouth-watering barbecues. Vulnerability and sheer hard work.           
         
Two microphones, two wooden boxes, two performers. They begin to share stories of childhood, of how they came to be the people they are. They share hopes and fears, successes and failures, role models and nemeses. She DJs while he builds. She dances while he builds. He cooks. They are together.            
              
With traditional roles for men and expectations of masculinity in flux, continued privilege afforded to 'the white male,' and the current political climate in the UK, *Manpower* has a lot to talk about… A conversation. A tribute. A healthy dose of nostalgia. A navigation through culture and people and becoming ourselves.          
         
#### Who are they?        
Two Destination Language make contemporary performance that's beautiful, arresting and accessible; sometimes it's called theatre, sometimes live art, sometimes dance theatre — Word of Warning most recently presented their heartfelt [*Near Gone*](/archive/2014-spring/2destlang) in 2014.                
         
Led by artists Katherina Radeva and Alister Lownie, their work explores questions of identity, belonging and culture; as a Bulgarian and a Scot working together, they use their own histories and experiences to explore these ideas.            
          
UK-based, they are currently resident Company at Salisbury Arts Centre and supported artists at The Point, Eastleigh. *Near Gone* won them a Total Theatre Award for Innovation, Experimentation & Playing With Form, and the Pulse Ipswich Suitcase Prize.
