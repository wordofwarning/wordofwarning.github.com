#### In Brief
Sit back and relax to the dulcet tones of Richard DeDomenici's songs that aren’t real, facts that are funny, and jokes that don’t rhyme, in his new show *Popaganda*.    
A jetlagged litterpicker of the world's cultural landfill, watch DeDomenici throw western civilisation at the wall, caution to the wind, and see what sticks.    
Like a can of tomato soup *Popaganda* is condensed, easily digestible, and likely to stain.

####Who is he?
Artist, Filmmaker, Raconteur and Manufacturer of Dangerous Toys since 1798.    

####What people have said about him
>The thinking man's Ashton Kutcher<br>*Matt Trueman, The Guardian*    
>Beautiful acts of absurdity highlighting more serious issues.  Frighteningly effective.<br>*The Guardian*       
>Clever, tremendously funny, powerfully political and unafraid to be accessible.  Think of comic activist Mark Thomas crossed with TV satirist Chris Morris, and you have something approximating DeDomenici.<br>*The Sunday Herald*    
>This is the Future<br>*Time Out*
