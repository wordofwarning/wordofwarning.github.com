#### About         
*Oreo, coconut, Bounty Bar* — micro-aggressions used to disempower a black person deemed to be 'acting white'.<br><br>A semi-autobiographical solo about being a successfully educated black woman within western society, *Oreo Prelude* interrogates racial micro-aggressions and their effect on mental health within private and public personas — focusing on public figures such as British MP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott" target="_blank">Diane Abbott</a> + Portuguese politician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joacine_Katar_Moreira" target="_blank">Joacine Katar Moreira</a>.<br><br>Exploring the racial term 'Oreo' in relation to experiences of episodic racism within higher education and employment, Tania challenges the notion of whitening her physical and phenomenal self to achieve success in society, asking you to open-up and join-in to celebrate a moment of freedom, a moment of clarity.<br><br>**Please note** this isn't the developed show we planned to present at STUN in April — rather than attempt to show something not designed for livestreaming, *Oreo Prelude* is an exploration of one action-based section (developed over four days following Tania's residency in Senegal with Kaolack, a Czech-based choreographer specialising in Traditional + Afro-Contemporary dance practices).        
        
#### Artist        
A Manchester-based solo performance artist, Tania Camara works across devised theatre, dance, site-specific, live art, installation, video + photography. A graduate of the University of Amsterdam with an MA, she uses her cultural heritage, past experiences, research + the interdisciplinary structure of Batuku (incl. singing, dancing, drums + spoken word). Tania's current practice focuses on personal accounts of memory, collective and ancestral, to uncover her racial and cultural identity; the concept of self and other; belonging and the black performing body.<br><br>??Tania is a member of <a href="http://thelowry.com/about-us/artist-development/class-of-programme" target="_blank">The Lowry's Class of 2020</a>.
