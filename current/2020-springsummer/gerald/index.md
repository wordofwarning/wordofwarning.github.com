#### Who is he?        
Jamal is a Leeds-based artist whose work is conversational, socially conscious, a celebration of individuality, and focuses on identity and lived experiences — mostly making the type of work that he wants to see; trying to make sure that each piece he creates is a different form to the one he made before. He has made work for poetry slams, films, parties, cafes + theatres. Jamal started off his career with Leeds Young Authors, a creative writing and performance group for the ages of 13-19; with them, he has competed in poetry slam competitions nationally and in the USA, one of the competitions being *Brave New Voices*.         
           
He has made work in many different forms — such as a solo show where he shares autobiographical stories about being black and gay; to having one-to-one conversations about privilege; to stripping down to his underwear in the city centre of Leeds in a short film; to an interactive performance where he puts words in people's mouths. His first solo show *FADoubleGOT* toured nationally in 2016; he also co-devised + performed in the critically-acclaimed *Putting Words in Your Mouth*, devised + directed by Scottee. Jamal's work has also been shown at SPILL, Leeds Playhouse, Battersea Arts Centre + the Barbican.
