####In Brief                      
Ellie Stamp is the secret love child of Elvis.    

In this autobiographical interactive performance — created with neuroscientist research partners — Ellie utilises her skills in participation and music to examine the problematic methodology used to define psychosis. She invites the audience to play with 9 numbers that fascinated Sir Issac Newton, Pythagoras and Elvis.

*What is the difference between an imaginative thought and a delusional belief?*

####Who is she?    
Ellie Stamp is an artist, activist and mental health campaigner who feels conflicted by labels and swears a lot.    
Here are some of the labels other people give Ellie Stamp:    
Live artist, performance maker, campaigner, activist, queer, mental, female, femme, man, woman, dyke, secret love child of Elvis, producer, singer, director, dyslexic, musician, feminist, pain in the arse, dramaturg, weirdo.   

Ellie's practice is driven by her confusion towards labels; how illness or disorders and appropriate behaviour are constructed and quantified.
Ellie makes devised performance that sits somewhere between live art, theatre and game mainly in non-traditional spaces, engaging unsuspecting audiences in live art practice. Ellie's performance work is usually interdisciplinary, participatory and experiential, embracing all forms of dialogue, co-creation and points of exchange with an audience to create fun spaces where audiences consider difficult subject matter with the aim to provoke social change.   

Ellie also works with other artists as a dramaturg, is a visiting artist at De Montfort University, runs workshops, takes promotional photos and makes music.

>*Stamp is a sharply engaging performer and the questions she asks cloud preconceived certainties about this complex subject.*<br>The Stage    
>*The interactive element of the show is deftly handled, drawing us in with a hint of gameplay before later unveiling the intelligence behind what had felt like sheer silliness.*<br>Exeunt Magazine    
>*Skillfully executed and resonant Stamp has created a work which needs to be seen by anyone wishing to understand better the subject of mental health that is so easily dismissed or deemed taboo.*<br>Total Theatre Review
