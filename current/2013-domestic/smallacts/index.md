####More      
*Shower Scenes* invites you to take a private shower and step into the role of the solitary, wet and naked bather.        
          
Experience the very real physical sensation of warm water running over you body. Wash yourself and watch video imagery projected onto the shower curtain. Feel the steam rise and wonder who is the viewer, who is the victim, who is innocent?
