####In Brief                      
In life, as on stage, Lindsay knows the importance of the grand entrance and the dramatic exit… but is everything in the middle just a show? And who, exactly, is she playing?

####More       
When they make the film of your life, who will you cast in the lead role? Will you play yourself? What scenes will you discard? Which version of yourself will you choose to portray?    

*Exit Smiling* is an unfinished story, with an absentee protagonist, performed by a series of remarkably similar stand-ins… because being forgotten is so much worse than death, don’t you think?

####Who is she?    
Lindsay is an actress and artist based in the north west, with a spectrum of performance diversity and history in Black Light Puppetry, Burlesque, theatre and screen acting. Her work is largely based on autobiographical experience and has been recognised in her approach to the cinematic and burlesquian aesthetic. *Exit Smiling* is her second solo show, having performed *6:41pm Mercury Complex* for [Emergency 2013](/archive/2013-emergency/z2).
