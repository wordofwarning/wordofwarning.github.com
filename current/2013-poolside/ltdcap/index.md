**Kitty Graham | The Bare Earth**        
*You stand before a bed of earth. Perhaps it is empty, still, peaceful — perhaps it is not.*        
Using a bed of earth — the place of death and decay, as well as creation and growth, and continual transformer of one into the other — *The Bare Earth* explores what might emerge when unconscious contents are freed in liminal ritual, and how these contents may be transformed by contact with consciousness.

**PGB | FTSE**    
*I have a secret. Do you have a secret?*        
We all have secrets. Some we will share and some we won't. What is your secret worth? I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours...    
        
**Rachel Gomme | Handover**    
*If I give you my hand, will you give me yours?*        
An invitation to a brief exchange of touch that leaves a lasting trace.
