Our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, **Emergency**, celebrates its 15th birthday…! To get a feel for it see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-emergency) + [gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).           
             
The fifteenth **Emergency** takes place on Saturday 4 October 2014 (12noon-11pm) at Manchester's [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here), with the callout for artist proposals open from Friday 25 July to Monday 25 August, 5pm — full details posted [here](http://emergencymcr.posthaven.com). With a whole range of spaces to fill, what we now need is lots of great work! So…                   
             
###Call for proposals — Emergency 2014      
*Artists working in live art, contemporary performance, time-based media and interdisciplinary arts are invited to submit proposals of short pieces of work, works-in-progress or extracts of longer works for inclusion in this event. Proposals are also encouraged for durational, one-to-one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces; since this is our 15th year, we're not averse to ideas for a finale!*        
             
**Emergency is:**    
>A free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
>An opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
>A selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).        
        
Work can be in any relevant artform/medium, though some live presence is desirable. Show-type work should be 20mins max in duration; low tech; suitable for quick turnarounds; self-supporting in terms of props / set / equipment and specialised technology. We also strongly encourage durational, one-to-one and limited capacity work; performance installation and intervention-based works in and around the spaces.             
            
Emergency 2014 will offer an honorarium of up to £100 per piece selected, to cover fees/expenses.
