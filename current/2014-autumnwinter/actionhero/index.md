####In Brief
Everything rests on this one free throw. On this one last shot. On these last few seconds. Action Hero have got their game faces on. With a nostalgic yearning for the simplicity of a world that never really existed, *Hoke’s Bluff* uses the hackneyed formulas of high-school storylines and the cheap sentimentality of inspiring locker-room speeches to find out what it means to be a winner (on the inside).
