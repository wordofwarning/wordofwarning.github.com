#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For the [first](/current/2020-domestic/july) in this new series of Domestic "at homes", we invited six artists to try out new works about what's on their minds — using whatever resources they have to hand… Join us in August for six new commentaries on where we find ourselves now.      
          
#### Credits
