**Hazard** is our biennial micro-festival of incidental intervention and sited performance, blurring the boundaries between art and activism… Nearly 100 artists have taken to the streets of Manchester including: Action Hero, Alex Bradley, Kris Canavan, Nicola Hunter Canavan, Jordan Mackenzie, Juliann O’Malley, Katherina Radeva, Michael Pinchbeck, Richard DeDomenici, Shahram Entekhabi + the vacuum cleaner.         
            
Our **[sixth Hazard](/current/2016-hazard)** pops up in Manchester's <a href='http://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zUP9hOfLluWs.kfWwdpVK74IU' target='_blank'>St Ann's Square</a> and surrounding streets on Saturday 9 July 2016, with the callout for artists open now - read on. For a glimpse of previous outbreaks of hazardous behaviour see 2014's [programme](/archive/2014-hazard) + [image gallery](/galleries/2014-hazard).            
            
So far we've wrapped Cathedral Gardens in fluttering hazard tape, hosted the world's slowest fairground ride, moved the goalposts (literally) and witnessed breastfeeding in a shop window — oh, and conducted a hoola-hoopathon; The Larks have had the public riddling, racing and chasing as urban archaeologists and private investigators, injecting mass gaming into St Ann's Square and beyond.           
           
**Call for Proposals:**     
*Think big, think bright, think irreverent!*     
Once again we are using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/St.+Ann's+Church/@53.4817584,-2.2454162,3a,75y,218.69h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syYuOT36eMUL4WFAfihEJIg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x487bb1c3df375453:0x799439d91859d49d!6m1!1e1" target="_blank">St. Ann’s Square</a> as our focal hub, with projects happening in, or radiating out from there.     
 We are now looking for proposals of work for a daytime event (Sat 9 July, 12noon-5pm) in Manchester City Centre - work that intervenes in public spaces in the city centre; interactive and playful; socially engaged, and/or conceptually motivated; and low- or no-tech and self-sufficient.     

We will give bonus points for creative engagement with the idea of hazard –chance, danger, risk, and/or use of yellow+black tape!
