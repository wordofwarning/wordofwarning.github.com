####In Brief
In 2010 a friend of Jenna's was the victim of a violent attack. Shocked to discover there were bystanders at the scene, Jenna created *Flâneurs* in an attempt to explore why we choose to intervene or not, and asks whether 'one punch is enough' to provoke an intervention. *Flâneurs* is a new piece of theatre that explores the nature of violence in our cities and attempts to deconstruct the 'bystander effect'.    
     
*The larger the crowd, the less likely it is that anyone will intervene...*    
     
**Winner of Scotsman Fringe First Award 2012.**

####More    
*Flâneurs* is a touching and effecting story of friendship, violence and intervention, that explores the nature of violent acts in public spaces, from a pedestrian subway in Edinburgh to Londonʼs Overground.    
    
Reflecting on her own city, Jenna examines why particular urban areas gain and retain a reputation for being rough or even dangerous and asks, what can we do, if anything, to change our own psychogeographic relationship to where we live. With first-hand accounts from the Scottish Constabulary and victims of violence, *Flâneurs* uses simple projections, psycho-geography and a little flâneuring to expose and deconstruct the social psychological phenomena known as the 'bystander effect'.

####What people have said about her       
>*4\* A richly thoughtful show.*<br>The Scotsman  
    
>*Utterly charming and surprisingly light-hearted.*<br>The Stage    
    
>*Give Jenna Watt an hour of your time, a projector and a toy giraffe: she'll change your whole outlook. Immense.*<br>Fringe Biscuit    
    
>*That casual air of Watt's stage presence, however, conflicts violently with the questions she is forcing us all to ask ourselves: am I a bystander, or am I a flâneur? These questions lead to a twist ending that will truly leave you dizzied.*<br>Broadway World
