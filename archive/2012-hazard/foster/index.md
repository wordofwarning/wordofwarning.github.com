A one-to-one performance that pays homage to travelling fortune-tellers in caravans, crystal balls and tall dark strangers. Your future will be told and your palm read in a 21st Century rendering of the traditional tools of fortune-telling.

Over the past twelve years Annette Foster has created multimedia solo performance art and video pieces. The content of her work has grown from an autobiographical view of psychological and emotional life to a more curious mix of feminism, identity, gender, difference and sexuality. Annette has exhibited her work regionally, nationally and internationally including: Arizona, Washington, Chicago, Colorado, Nottingham, Leicester, Hull, Derby, Bristol, Manchester, Glasgow and Dieppe, France.
