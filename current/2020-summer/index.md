#### About         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful, and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of greenroom's 25-year legacy, and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond… including online.           
            
>*If you haven’t attended one of these performance evenings yet, WTF are you doing? Go and see the stimulating new work that’s out there!*<br>&nbsp;— <a href=" http://number9reviews.blogspot.com/2019/11/theatre-review-tom-cassani-i-promise.html" target="_blank">Number 9 Reviews on WTF Wednesdays (November 2019)</a>        
      
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all.<br>Over the past 8½ years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, and beautiful work by the likes of Ron Athey, Amy Bell, Chanje Kunda, Harry Clayton-Wright, Stacy Makishi, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater, Proud & Loud Arts, amongst others, and all-ages live art through [Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org).         
         
#### Audiences         
We don't want to put you off by talking labels — yes, there'll be theatre, live art, dance, performance etc. — our aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming, or just a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on, see what our audiences have said

#### Who
