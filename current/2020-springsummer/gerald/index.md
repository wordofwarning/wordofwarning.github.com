#### More         
Jamal grew up Catholic in a Caribbean household — but would rather light a candle and worship celebrities than white saints.          
          
Combining African diasporic ritual, live music + storytelling, *Idol* is a spiritual journey that asks what happens when you don't see yourself represented.         
        
Featuring a host of celebrity appearances.

#### Who is he?        
Jamal Gerald is a Leeds-based artist whose work is conversational, socially conscious, a celebration of individuality, and focuses on identity + lived experiences — mostly making the type of work that he wants to see, with the aim of taking up space as a Black queer person; trying to make sure that each piece he creates is a different form to the one he made before.

Jamal has made work for poetry slams, films, parties, cafes + theatres in many different forms — such as a solo show where he shares autobiographical stories about being Black + gay; to having one-to-one conversations about privilege; to stripping down to his underwear in the city centre of Leeds in a short film; to an interactive performance where he puts words in people's mouths…

Starting his career with the creative writing + performance group Leeds Young Authors, Jamal's first solo show *FADoubleGOT* toured nationally in 2016 (including to Contact); he co-devised + performed in the critically-acclaimed *Putting Words in Your Mouth* (devised + directed by Scottee); and his work has been shown at SPILL, Leeds Playhouse, Battersea Arts Centre + the Barbican.        
         
#### What people have said about his work

Speaks so clearly of the importance of representation.*<br>&nbsp;— Audience Response to *Idol* (<a href="http://transformfestival.org/event/idol" target="_blank">at Transform19</a>)<br>*There's a fresh, honest quality to Gerald's performance.
