####In Brief

How does love exist when you're not there? Live Letter is about absence, love, and your best handwriting.

####Who is she?

Ten years ago Lowri didn’t get into drama school so she studied art. She moved to Manchester, learnt to think sideways, formed a punk band and found her own way to make theatre.   

####What people have said about her

>Compelling - *David Hoyle* 

>Lowri is one of the most interesting emerging artists and performance makers in the North West - *Richard Gregory, Quarantine, 2011*

####More

Lowri has a long history of putting her heart on the line. In the increasing blurring of her life and her work she has lamented about moments of goodbyes over train station tannoy systems, traced eighty year old school photographs and taken you for cups of tea on wasteland. She slid on the floor alongside you during rush hour in a slug suit; she told you everything in a book about the end of a relationship.    

This performance is no exception. By working as close as she can between her own life and her art she knows they reveal something about the other, and hopes to delve into the grey ocean of what it is to be human, in all its cruelty and splendour.

####Works Ahead: Performances

Three artists, three performances, three takes on singledom, absence and the onset of the thirties. An emerging programme full of surprises and an insight into performance that defies definition. 

October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-*'maze of performance'*: [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/). Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing *emergency accommodation* artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
