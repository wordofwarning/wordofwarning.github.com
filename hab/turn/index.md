**Turn** is our annual platform for NW dancers + dance-makers, featuring over 15 short pieces of work over two nights in Manchester.       
       
Our **[sixth Turn](/archive/2014-turn)** was at Contact on 4+5 April 2014, to get a feel for it see some [images](/galleries/2014-turn) — or delve further with 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-turn) + [image gallery](/galleries/2013-turn).       
       
**Turn is:**        
• a public micro-festival + open submission dance platform;        
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;        
• a selection platform for the Turn Prize (*a small, supported commission, supported by Dance Manchester, Contact, hÅb + Live at LICA*).
