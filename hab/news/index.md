**Live Art in the public realm** — working with Compass Live Art, we are partners for one of Live Art Development Agency's <a href="http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/opportunities/diy-2020-call-for-proposals" target="_blank">DIY 2020</a> opportunities.         
         
<a href="http://compassliveart.org.uk/" target="_blank">Compass Live Art</a> + [hÅb](/hab) would like to support a DIY concerned with artists working in the public realm + socially engaged practice. Compass has been commissioning artists to make live interactive projects with communities + groups since 2011, and hosting them in public spaces around Leeds. Among the many initiatives created by hÅb is [Hazard](/hab/hazard) which has been intervening in Manchester City Centre since 2007. While this DIY would not have to take place in the public realm, we'd like to see proposals that are issue-led, socially engaged + exploring a response to their environment. We expect it will be hosted in Leeds.
