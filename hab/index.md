### Stimulating… extraordinary… performance…   
        
Based in Manchester, hÅb is a producer, developer, and strategic advocate of contemporary performance, live art, and sited work in the North of England. greenroom's key partner for over a decade, hÅb aims to maintain its legacy — working in collaboration with a range of [venues + other partners](/hab/partners) to produce showing [opportunities](/hab/news), platforms, and artist development projects including [Divergency](/hab/divergencymcr), [Emergency](/hab/emergency), [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), [Hazard](/hab/hazard) + [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead).         
          
Essentially industry-facing, hÅb works with [artists, colleagues, venues + others](/hab/partners) to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish. A member of <a href="http://www.liveartuk.org" target="_blank">Live Art UK</a> — a national network supporting and developing the UK's Live Art infrastructure for the benefit of artists, presenters, and audiences — hÅb is supported using public funding by <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/NPO" target="_blank">Arts Council England</a>.          
        
Since Jan 2012, hÅb gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/) — a peripatetic programme of, and regular bulletin for, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond. *N.B. this part of our site aims to offer information to **artists** wanting to know more about hÅb's work and how to get involved; for more information about our public programme please see [Word of Warning](/).*       
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), an annual micro-festival for new live work which presents about 30 short pieces in a day each autumn (*next in Sep 2020, its twenty-first year*) and its former Merseyside sibling, ['Poolside Emergency](/hab/poolside); through [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work (*next in May 2020, its ninth year*) — we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance + live art.           
               
hÅb works as a curator of sited performance + intervention presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention that takes performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre (*last in Aug 2018, its seventh year*), as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our frequent foray into all ages live art with Z-arts (*last in Apr 2019, its fifth year*). We also co-produce [Turn](/hab/turn) with Contact, a regular micro-festival for new northern dance + dance-makers (*last in Apr 2017, its ninth year*).           
         
In any given year, hÅb might work with 150 artists, present two platforms, a sited festival, and show over 60 pieces of work as [Word of Warning](/).
