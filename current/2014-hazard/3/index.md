####3.30pm departure                
**Stephen Donnelly | *DriftMob***               
A culture-jamming game of follow-the-leader: players take it in turns to lead a city-wide improvisation through the streets of Manchester, dishing out impromptu happenings and interventions as they go. The DriftMob begins in St Ann's Square; from there the details get hazy… all we know is it conspires to mark out it’s territory before evaporating back into the swarm of the street, leaving its traces in memories, rumours and urban myths.                 
                
A Swansea-based performer, creating site-specific and site-responsive work which encourages audiences to explore and experience their surroundings in new and unexpected ways. His most recent large scale project was *Block Party*, a pervasive theatrical experience which took place throughout locations across Cardiff Bay, commissioned as part of PlayARC Games Festival at the WMC. Since 2013 he has been under commission by Creative Bubble to create performances and events in Swansea City Centre.

####3.30-4.15pm              
**Kris Canavan | *The Leveller***                
As a political movement, the term *Leveller* first referred to a faction of New Model Army Agitators and their London supporters in 1649 who were allegedly plotting to assassinate the king; it had been used in 17th-century England as a term of abuse for rural rebels and in the Midland Revolt of 1607 to refer to those who 'levelled' hedges in enclosure riots. Organised at a national level, with offices in a number of London inns and taverns such as The Rosemary Branch in Islington, Levellers would identify one another by sprigs of rosemary that they would wear in their hats...
