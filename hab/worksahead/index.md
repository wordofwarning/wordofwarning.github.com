**Works Ahead** is a new project, developed out of the old Method Lab + SeedFund schemes we ran with greenroom. Started in 2012, it aims to offer very small supported work-in-development commissions for artists selected from the year's **[Emergency](/hab/emergency)** platform and/or other events. Support includes mentoring and a public showing of the next stage of the work…       
        
The first Works Ahead took place in May/June **2012** with a new partnership at Contact (as a Re:Con co-production), featuring a night of performances from Gareth Cutter, Lowri Evans, Krissi Musiol; and an evening of interactions from Angel Club (north), Fallen Wall Arts, Julieann O'Malley, Small Acts… See the [programme](/archive/2012-woah) + [image gallery](/galleries/2012-woah).        
        
The second Works Ahead took place in May **2013**, once more at Contact, with a night of work that moved you from 70/30 Split, Kitty Graham, Joseph Lau + Ellen Turner (*winner of the 2012 Turn Prize*); and a night of work that spoke to you from Lena Simic, Façade Theatre, Wayne Steven Jackson… See the [programme](/archive/2013-worksahead) + [image gallery](/galleries/2013-woah).        
       
The third Works Ahead took place 8+9 May **2014** at Contact, with a triple-bill of work that delved into the mindset of the performer from Lindsay Bennett, Paul O’Donnell + SheepKnuckle… See the [programme](/archive/2014-worksahead) + [image gallery](/galleries/2014-woah).
