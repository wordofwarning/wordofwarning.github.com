### Friday 3 + Saturday 4 June 2016        
**Different stages, different scales, still Works Ahead…**          
Two very different double bills make up our annual sampler of what's next in contemporary performance and live art — pushing the boundaries of form and content. [Autumn 2015](/archive/2015-autumnwinter) saw Word of Warning show over 40 emerging performances in spaces ranging from a building site to a theatre… From this enormous variety of work we have invited four artists at different stages in their careers to further develop their shows for Works Ahead 2016. They're all at the very beginning of their explorations…        
        
**Compact Edition, 5pm + 6pm. £4/2**        
Hidden stories and half-remembered truths from Terri Donovan + Afreena Islam.        
         
**Evening Edition, 7.30pm. £6/3**          
From Dyson to the Passion — an unpredictable double bill from Top Joe + Lucy McCormick.        
        
### Artists        
**Terri Donovan**        
"*Finding Elsie* is about me, my Dad, my Gran… and dementia. This is my exploration of how relationships change and continue to change in my attempt to find a true reflection of my Elsie."

**Afreena Islam**        
"I've only been alive for about 30% of my dad's life, so I've been trying to piece together what happened in the 70% I wasn't…"<br>A daughter telling secondhand stories to strangers, trying to navigate her dad's journey to help her figure out her own.

**Lucy McCormick**         
"I have cast myself as God in a large scale biblical re-enactment, performed via pop ballads and performance art with the help of two backing dancers. I was partly inspired to create this work by an ongoing interest in the Quaker belief in 'God' as one's own moral conscience — that of 'God in everyone'.<br>The piece is also an exercise in casting myself as the Ultimate Man, allowing for my interests and frustrations in gender politics and feminist discourse."

**Top Joe**             
Top Joe is a timid character who wears a hi-vis jacket and only comes out at night. He occasionally braves leaving the house in order to meet people and give his thoughts on life, vouchers and pistachios.<br>For Works Ahead he is developing a piece that explores the nature of Ross Kemp, Dyson vacuum cleaners, identity, comedy, and childhood.
