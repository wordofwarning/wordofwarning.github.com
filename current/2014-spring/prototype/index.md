####More            
*The Good, the God and the Guillotine* is a personal answer to the universal question, and was inspired by a reading of Albert Camus’ powerful 1942 novel *L’Étranger* (*The Stranger*).        
          
*A long walk, the beach. A fight, a murder. The heat, and the barking of dogs. We’re travelling out of the sun and towards darkness.*        
        
Three performers and three laptop musicians create an atmospheric, cross-genre journey through a tangle of relationships and technologies, all set against reactive objects, lights and hand-drawn animations.         
            
Proto-type Theater, collaborating with the musician/composers of MMUle, lighting designer Rebecca M. K. Makus and animator Adam York Gregory, present a performance sung and spoken across thirteen distinct chapters.
