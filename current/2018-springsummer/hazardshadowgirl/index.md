#### More         
Shadowy figures move silently through the city, playing, questioning, exploring visibility & vulnerability...      
*Shadow Girl* was a creative response to 2015 government statistics showing that GMP recorded the UK’s 2nd highest rate of hate crime – with the number of disablity motivated crimes more than doubling since 2014.     
*Shadow Girl* is about a girl that has become afraid of people & become a shadow of herself as result of the things people say about her. She can hear & understand the things that are said & every time she hears hurtful words they chip away a little bit of her light.    

Sometimes it’s more than words & people are often fearful of making themselves visible or going outside.    
       
#### Who is she      
Christina Jones is a 29 year old Manchester artist living with a Learning Disability Label - a long standing artist with Proud & Loud Arts currently working with the Lowry, DIY and Access all Areas.     
*Shadow Girl* is her first solo work, originally developed as part of Proud & Loud Arts’ group work ‘Cells – A Body of Work’- here expanded and developed on a larger scale. In Shadow Girl, Christina wants to bring a positive discussion about learning disability to a wider public audience through a creative intervention in public spaces.
