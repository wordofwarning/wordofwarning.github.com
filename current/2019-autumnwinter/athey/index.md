#### More         
Inspired in part by the secret society of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C3%A9phale" target="_blank">Acéphale</a> — the 1930s anti-fascist review and magazine published by philosopher Georges Bataille — Ron Athey's new work uses projections, readings, lectures, appropriated text and sound.         
           
By re-imagining cut-up technique pioneer Brion Gysin's brutalist *Pistol Poem* as a vocal/percussive choreography, Athey turns to the Acéphale — the eponymous figure of the headless man; a powerful symbol of radical transformation — and attempts to make sense of a current reality where neo-fascism is mutating, creeping, and marching.
         
#### Who is he?        
American performance artist Ron Athey rose to international prominence in the 90s, making performance that explored challenging subjects like the relationships between desire, sexuality and traumatic experience, and confronted conservative narratives around AIDS, S&M and body autonomy.
