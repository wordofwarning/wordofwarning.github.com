##COMING SOON    
**A day-long splash of live art and performance in Liverpool**

Mayhem on Merseyside: returning for its third frenetic outing, this mini-marathon of the weird and the wonderful, the bizarre and the breathtaking takes over at the Bluecoat.

Previously at 'Poolside: a hunting party leading a charge and visceral experiments with butter and treacle; slow-dances in the lifts and singing in the toilets; mermaids in the cupboards and bucket-dancing in the stairwells.

Drop-in for ten minutes or stay throughout – a free day-out for the curious.

Participating artists (subject to change):    
A Bottle Top Productions | Fiona Anderson | Lindsay Bennett | David Bethell | Megan Clark-Bagnall | Jack Coverdale | Façade Theatre | Frances-Kay | Rachel Gomme | Kitty Graham | Sarah Grainger-Jones | Martin Hamblen | Lara Haworth & Lucy Hayhoe | Michelle Man & Lauren McGowan | Sophie Nathan | Julieann O'Malley | Louise Orwin | Paper People Theatre | Xristina Penna + aswespeakproject | PGB | Rebekka Platt | Rosanne Robertson | Moreno Solinas | Sarah Spanton / Waymarking | Sam Treadaway
