#### More         
Featuring running, hurdling, jumping, throwing… a tetra-decathlon is 14 kinds of daft.<br><br>Having never been for a jog around the park or even set foot on an athletics track, Lauren signed up to compete in the World Ultra Multievent Championships — committing to learn fourteen track and field disciplines from scratch and then compete in just 600 days. As she runs, jumps, and throws herself into a world of serious amateurs and comedic coaches, Lauren discovers that winning is not simply about crossing the line first.<br><br>Charting her journey from couch to competition, *Tetra-Decathlon* questions the psychology of sport and what drives us to compete in an amusing and inspiring solo for all those who got picked last, but know there's more to give.

#### What people have said about *Tetra-Decathlon*         
>*…a lovely, affecting piece on what it means to take on a seemingly outlandish task, to try, to fail, to try again.*<br><a href="http://www.fest-mag.com/edinburgh/theatre/review-tetra-decathlon-by-showroom" target="_blank">Fest Mag</a><br>*…Hendry’s simply structured but impressively sweaty 60 minutes asks some piercing questions about failure and success, amateur and professionals, being a hero and being a fool and why we keep going against all the odds. It may not leave you as breathless as its protagonist, but it does keep you gripped.*<br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/reviews/edinburgh-festival-2018-fringe-shows-review-lyn-gardner-everything-not-saved-lights-over-tesco-a8500736.html" target="_blank">Lyn Gardner, The Independent</a>
