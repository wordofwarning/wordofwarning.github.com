**Turn** is our annual platform for NW dancers + dance-makers, featuring up to 17 short pieces of work over two nights in Manchester.       
       
Our **[sixth Turn](/archive/2014-turn)** took place on Friday 4 + Saturday 5 April 2014, at Contact. To get a feel for it see 2014's [programme](/archive/2014-turn) + [image gallery](/galleries/2014-turn).       
       
**Turn is:**        
• a public micro-festival + open submission dance platform;        
• an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;        
• a selection platform for the Turn Prize (*a small, supported commission, supported by Dance Manchester, Contact, hÅb + Live at LICA*);         
• enquiries: <mailto:turn@habarts.org> ¦ <http://www.turnmcr.org> ¦ #TurnMcr
