#### More               
*We shall not cease from exploration<br>And the end of all our exploring<br>Will be to arrive where we started<br>And know the place for the first time.*<br>— T. S. Eliot (*Little Gidding*)            
             
"If you want, I could describe to you every inch of my Grandma's living room: the carpet — crimson red with the Persian pattern; the sofa — soda cream four-seater in a soft weft weave; the TV — wide-screen with a dozen illegal DVDs stored safely underneath; the armchair — cracked maroon leather placed next to a full glass ashtray; the window — facing the road and boarding school, the long grass tumbling continually amongst the sand and wind. I know this room like the back of my hand. But the blur in this landscape is — Her.               
            
*Finding Elsie* is an exploration using words, sound and movement to answer the questions we all face: *Who are you? Who am I?*                
             
I cannot promise to find any answers — I had the privilege of knowing my Elsie for 19 years, 10 months, 19 days, 3 hours and 45 minutes, and I still haven't figured out who that great Mancunian lady was.       

I have a whisper of time to share with you mine and her moments, and perhaps finally — to truly find my Elsie for the first time."

Terri is a former member of Contact Young Company, involved in the Stacy Makishi directed *Under the Covers* at Contact, BAC + Southbank Centre, London and Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh; Rodolfo Amorim + Lowri Evans’s sited *The Shrine of Everyday Things*; and Commonwealth’s *How To Be Better*.
