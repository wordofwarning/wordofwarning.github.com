#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
For our [pilot "Domestic at home"](/current/2020-domestic/july), we invited six artists to try out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand. Join us in August for a second set of "artists at home", newly selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">open call for proposals</a>.
