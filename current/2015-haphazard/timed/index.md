**Ultra Violets | *Labolis Goes Wild***        
Welcome to the jungle… pick up a pirate map from Captain Jack and embark on a perilous quest for buried treasure.  Fish in the lagoon and unravel the spiderweb riddle in search of the elusive clues.    

In [Haphzard 2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard/index.html), the Ultra Violets brought mayhem in the minotaur’s maze.  Now be enticed to explore but remember - it’s a jungle out there!

**Levantes Dance Theatre | *The Western Frontier (work-in-progress)***        
A playful exploration of love in a western landscape or an adventure in love, loss and banjos...    
A return to Manchester for eccentrically engaging and offbeatly odd Word of Warning favourites, Levantes Dance Theatre.    
A work in development commissioned by hÅb for Haphazard.

####1-3pm (durational) + 3-3.10pm performance		
**Liz Clarke | *My Inflatable One***        
A cross between a rubbery, exploding 'sewing bee' and an odd cabaret. 
Part mundane, part spectacle, part wonderment, this encounter charts the quest for *Bigger! Better! More!* through the medium of balloons and silly soundtracks.   
	
Liz Clarke is a performance maker who the boundaries between reality and dreamscape. Shows include *I Tattooed My Baby* (she didn't) and *Cannonballista*, a dark human cannonball show (she did).
