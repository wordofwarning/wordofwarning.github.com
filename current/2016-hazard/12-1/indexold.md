**Jin Bells | *Head in Hole 2016***         
Floating, completely still with my head buried in a hole in a wall… this meaningless action seeks to confront its audience, whether they are suspecting or not…

**Alex Bradley + Bill Leslie | *COME AS YOU ARE (guerrilla mix 1.0)***

**Nathaniel Mason | *Occupied***          
Dying, desperate, gagging, bursting. This archive of public convenience is made by the people for the people.           
            
**Sexcentenary | *WE REFUSE TO BE UNSEEN***         
Using humour and a sense of the absurd, a collective of women who identify as older, set about disrupting the flow of public spaces.
