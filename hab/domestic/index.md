**2020's series of Domestic "at homes"** invites artists to try out ideas online…<br>What can you make when your kitchen table is the stage + your camera is the audience?        
           
Our pilot on **1 July** presented six guest artists, and on **12 August** selected seven works from our open call for .  

An online beta-test platform for new live art + contemporary performance from artist's homes — using whatever resources you have to hand. We're interested in whatever you are interested in saying right now — see our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">open call for proposals</a> for **7 October**.


*In the interests of full disclosure, we're aware that appetite for making work online is on the wane — so we're using this call out as a litmus test. We believe that this is only worth doing if we can do it well — so if the right work isn't there to make up a really good programme for 7 October, we might all be better served by not doing it!         
         
#### *Domestic origins…*         
In 2013/15/17 we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…         
         
**November 2013** saw a series of intimate interactions, homely conversations + domestic dramas played out in a block of flats, still inhabited but in the midst of major refurbishment — [**Domestic**](/archive/2013-domestic) hosted 7 pieces over 10 days by artists including the vacuum cleaner, Jo Bannon and Fergus J Evans, with work ranging from an immersive environment in a garage, to a solo naked shower piece and a woman's story of domestic despair atop a ¼ton of potatoes… See the [image gallery](/galleries/2013-domestic).         
         
**In September 2015, [Domestic II](/archive/2015-domestic)** was unleashed on a new block of flats, this time uninhabited, but definitely mid-refurbishment — Matthias Court (M3 6JD) was a space in transition — using only the top (15th) + ground floors over 3 nights + a day to show 17 pieces by artists including Leo Burtin, Ria Hartley, Catherine Hoffman, Cheryl Martin, Michael Pinchbeck + Louise Wallwein… See a rapid overview <a href="http://vimeo.com/143630694" target="_blank">on vimeo</a> + the [image gallery](/galleries/2015-domestic).        
        
**In November 2017, [*Rent Party: Domestic Edition*](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard)** popped up next door in Salford's Adelphi Court during its refurb… Part show, part party, Darren Pritchard Dance's joyously defiant stand against growing up poor is a 21st century, austerity Britain, black, gay, immersive musical — for those just about managing. See the [image gallery](/galleries/2017-domestic). Thanks to our generous audiences we donated £574.65 & four crates of food to Salford Foodbank.        
        
Domestic (2020) is presented by [Word of Warning](/) + produced by [hÅb](/hab).
