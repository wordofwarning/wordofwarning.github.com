#### Saturday 21 September, 12noon-10pm. Pay What You Decide             
Manchester's twentieth annual manic micro-marathon of the bizarre + the beautiful: from gallery to theatre, store-cupboard to stairwell, some 30 live works in a travelling takeover of three Hulme venues…         
            
**During the day** dip in and out of ongoing performances, installations and limited capacity experiences at NIAMOS; **in the evening** join us for a series of short sit-down shows at STUN Studio + Z-arts. **Sample the different — then pay what you decide!**          
        
*Participating artists subject to change.*
