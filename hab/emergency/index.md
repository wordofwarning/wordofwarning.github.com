**Emergency** is our annual platform for live art + contemporary performance, featuring at least 20 short pieces of work over a day/evening in Manchester… 
             
Staged for the first time entirely in the cavernous realms of [Z-arts](http://www.z-arts.org/about-us/getting-here), our **fifteenth Emergency** takes place on Saturday 4 October 2014 (12noon-11pm) — expect the unexpected, popping up all over the building. Please note: Emergency is largely adult-focussed and some works will not be suitable for under-18s. To get a feel for it see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-emergency) + [gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).        
      
**Emergency is:**    
• A free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
• An opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
• A selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by [hÅb](/hab).            
• Enquiries: <mailto:emergency@habarts.org>        
        
Emergency 2014 is presented by Word of Warning; produced by hÅb; supported using public funding through Arts Council England, and by Manchester City Council, STUN + Z-arts; a greenroom legacy project.
