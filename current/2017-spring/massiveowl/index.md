A new story inspired by three of the voiceless characters in Stephen King's novella *The Body* and its 1986 cult film adaptation *Stand By Me* — expect distorted sound, movement and projection as Massive Owl contort the book's characters and twist the film's soundtrack into a reimagined story about loss and acceptance. Welcome to *Castle Rock*…         
       
#### Who are they?        
A Bristol-based collaborative performance company making cinematic work that sits between theatre and live art, Massive Owl tell stories and in the process challenge how a story can look, sound and feel.         
         
Founded in 2009 by Adrian Spring, Danny Prosser, Richard Mowbray + Sam Powell whilst studying at Dartington College of Arts/Falmouth University, they are currently Danny Prosser, Jenny Duffy + Sam Powell.

Making and touring work across the UK and internationally — most notably the Barbican (London), Project Arts Centre (Dublin), Mayfest (Bristol) — they have also run workshops at various UK universities and are associate artists of <a href="http://www.livecollision.com" target="_blank">Live Collision</a> + members of <a href="http://www.intervalbristol.org" target="_blank">Interval</a> artist collective.

#### What people have said about them         
>*The performance work they create sits somewhere between physical theatre and live art, with their ability to 'story-tell' through the most minimal of means making their work both complex and accessible.*<br>Kate Craddock, Gateshead International Festival of Theatre (GIFT).        
*Castle Rock* at The Lowry is a <a href="http://www.creativetourist.com/theatre" target="_blank">creative tourist </a> top theatre pick.
