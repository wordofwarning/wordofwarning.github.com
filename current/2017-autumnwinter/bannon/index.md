#### More         
>"I was born on the day the Pope came to Coventry, my home town. In my family this unexpected appearance was perceived as a blessing. A sublime gift."        
        
Influenced by her experience as a person with albinism, Jo Bannon uses blinding light, proximity, movement and sound to create an extraordinary visual poem.         
        
*Alba* explores the stories we tell of ourselves and the stories told about us, the myths we inherit and the ones we embody, the identities we cannot shake off and so instead perform.

Jo Bannon is a Bristol-based artist who makes live art and performance. She has presented work in the UK and Europe â€” Word of Warning presented her intimate [*Exposure*](/archive/2013-domestic/bannon) in 2013's Domestic.

#### WTF Wednesday ticketing policy at The Lowry         
Please note that as not everyone who reserves tickets uses them, to make sure we have a full house we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right, but unfortunately we occasionally have to disappoint people so please arrive early. However, where possible, if you do miss out we will try to get you in to another show at The Lowry that evening.
