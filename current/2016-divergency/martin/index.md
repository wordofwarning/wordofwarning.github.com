#### In Brief                           
A jazz fantasy about loss, love and hope set among the stars.  Combining science fact, real-world psychological observation, and autobiography with lots and lots of live jazz vocals to ask why some stars shine more brightly than others, human and celestial, and why people love to watch them fall.
