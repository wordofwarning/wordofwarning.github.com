# Welcome to our new [Autumn/Winter Collection](/current/2012-autumnwinter/index.html). Huge thanks to all the artists, venues, technicians, volunteers and audiences for the monumental weekend just gone - a full-on crescendo of a gig with Action Hero vs. GO Project at Gorilla and the frantic frenzy that was Emergency 2012.

# Next up we have a mammoth double-bill of shows featuring [Ollie Smith's *27*](http://www.wordofwarning.org/current/2012-autumnwinter/olliesmith/index.html) and [Richard Dedomenici's *Popaganda*](http://www.wordofwarning.org/current/2012-autumnwinter/dedomenici/index.html) on Fri 2 November at Z-arts.
