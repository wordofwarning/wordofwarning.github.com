Essentially industry-facing, we work with [artists, colleagues, venues + others](/hab/partners) to create the best possible opportunities for new work to flourish. Upcoming artist opportunities from [hÅb](/hab) are published below when we have them — you may also find it useful to join these mailing lists:

To participate in a future [online Domestic](/hab/domestic), please see our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for artist's proposals</a> — we sense that artist's appetite for showing their work online from home is currently waning, but please feel free to suggest something as we'll put together our sixth online event later this year when we've got the right content.
