Since January 2012, however hÅb gone 'public' in the guise of [Word of Warning](/index) — a peripatetic programme of, and regular bulletin for, contemporary live work in Manchester + beyond. *N.B. this site aims to offer information to artists wanting to know more about our work and how to get involved; for more information about our public programme please see [Word of Warning](/index).*   
        
From [Emergency](/hab/emergency), an annual micro-festival for new live work (now in its nineteenth year) which presents over 20 short pieces in a day each autumn (and its former Merseyside sibling, ['Poolside Emergency](/hab/poolside)); through [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead), a series of small commissions for new work (now in its seventh year) — we aim to provide a joined-up series of opportunities for emerging new work and artists in contemporary performance + live art. We also co-produce [Turn](/hab/turn), a regular micro-festival for new northern dance + dance-makers (last in April 2017).    
        
hÅb also works as a curator of sited performance and intervention presenting [Hazard](/hab/hazard), a biennial micro-festival of intervention, taking performance out of the black box environment and into Manchester city centre (next in July 2018), as well as [Haphazard](/hab/haphazard), our more frequent foray into all ages live art in Z-arts (last in April 2017).             
        
In any given year, hÅb might work with 200 artists, present 2 platforms, 1 sited festival and show over 100 pieces of work (under the guise of [Word of Warning](/index)).      
         
hÅb is supported using public funding by Arts Council England + funded by Manchester City Council.
