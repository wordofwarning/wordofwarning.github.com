#### What people have said about Works Ahead        
>*A cathartic, funny and brutally honest show about bodies, particles and the universe.*<br><a href="http://afronalysis.com/2017/05/14/review-superposition-stun" target="_blank">Afronalysis (2017 review)</a>           
>*Maybe not what you'd regard as traditional 'theatre', but compelling nonetheless …make you think that anything could happen in the performance space.*<br><a href="http://quietmandave.co.uk/2016/06/works-ahead" target="_blank">QuietManDave (2016 review)</a>           
>• *Great to see new work by younger artists.<br>• Brilliant works in progress, varied and interesting.<br>• I enjoyed both shows even though they were very different. I look forward to seeing how they develop.*<br>[Audience feedback from 2016](/archive/2016-worksahead)/[15](/archive/2015-worksahead)
