####More   
Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton expose the inner workings of their business by presenting everything as art — from the food served, the people serving, the décor and public display of their bank balance, to the lovingly hand-picked charity shop crockery.               
                      
*Hunt & Darton Cafe* encourages playful participation and meaningful social encounters — through its alternative service from hosts Hunt & Darton in their iconic fruit or veggie attire, comic interaction through their 'set menu' performances, guest waiters and themed days such as 'You-Do-It' or 'Health & Safety day'. Popping-up as [the hub for Manchester's SICK! Festival](http://www.sickfestival.com/programme/manchester/hunt-darton-cafe), guest waiters include Pigeon Theatre, Nicki Hobday + Sara Cocker and Erini Kartsaki.                     
                      
Responding to SICK! Festival will be theme days such as 'Sexy day' — where it is encouraged to speak frankly about sex with phallic food served up accompanied by sexual innuendo — and hosted talks collaborating with medical practitioners, academics, artists and local groups. Imagine being served tea whilst getting that leg looked at! Or perhaps a bowl of Coco Pops served up with a conversation about mental health…            
                      
**Food on offer** includes cakes (Battenberg!), light lunches and H&D's signature dish, the roast dinner sandwich.<br>**Things to spot** include The Survival Shelf, the "not" menu, Takeaway Art, the Boss mug, the quote of the day, the sugar bearers, and (of course) pineapples.        
           
*Hunt & Darton Cafe are proud to satisfy appetites in more ways than one.*                   
                      
####Who are they?                
Hunt & Darton are a Live Art Collaboration between Jenny Hunt + Holly Darton, graduating together from Central Saint Martins in 2003. Approaching Live Art from a Fine Art background, they work across mediums with a sculptural approach to performance, choreographing words and movement in a sensory way and setting up alternative spaces — often creating installations to perform within.                  
                      
Deriving from shared celebrations and anxieties surrounding life choices particularly as women, in Britain, now, their work has been described as deadpan and absurd, often collapsing into humour. They have a persistent fetish within their practice to consistently re-assess their relationship with their audience — embracing awkward moments, risk taking and constantly trying to close the gap between performer and viewer — opting for a raw, underdone, conversational aesthetic.            
                      
Hunt & Darton are associate artists at Artsadmin + Cambridge Junction.
