*Our now regular Pay What You Decide Autumn season takes a [trip on the Brexit train](/archive/2018-autumnwinter/instantdissidence), and then [curls up under a warm duvet](/archive/2018-autumnwinter/makishi). Before all that join us for [Emergency](/archive/2018-emergency) — while ongoing austerity says go small, we've gone big with some 30 performances in just the one day… To keep in touch, <a href="{{ site.mailer_signup_url }}" target="_blank">sign-up</a> for our <a href="http://wordofwarning.posthaven.com" target="_blank">Weekly Warning</a> e-mail.*               
          
Brought to you by hÅb — with Sustained Theatre Up North, Z-arts, The Lowry — we look forward to seeing you at some or all of Autumn/Winter 2018. If you want to check out what happened last season take a look at our [Spring/Summer 2018 archive](/archive/2018-springsummer), and if you came to an event please help us by taking a few minutes to fill out our <a href="http://research.audiencesurveys.org/s.asp?k=152950990710" target="_blank">online survey</a>.                 
             
#### What is Word of Warning + where did it come from?         
>*Consistently refreshing and surprising, no season is ever the same…*          
         
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of new live performance — an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy, and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester + beyond…           
         
>*…a strand of alternative and fledgling work that has only recently got a new lease of life via Word of Warning and Emergency.*<br><a href="http://www.creativetourist.com/articles/theatre/manchester/manchester-theatre-lyn-gardner-on-a-city-reaching-beyond-the-theatrical-peaks" target="_blank">Creative Tourist on Manchester theatre (November 2014)</a>
         
We take live work very seriously — but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. Over the past 6½ years we've shown funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of FK Alexander, Jo Bannon, Richard DeDomenici, Eggs Collective, Nic Green, Ria Hartley, Stacy Makishi, Kim Noble, Deborah Pearson, Darren Pritchard, Proto-type Theater + Greg Wohead, amongst others. We've also created bonkers all ages live art ([Haphazard](http://haphazardmcr.org)), hosted [Hunt & Darton's pop-up art-café](/archive/2015-spring/h&d), unleashed bizarre behaviour upon Manchester's city centre ([Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org)), and created performance festivals in blocks of flats ([Domestic](http://domesticmcr.org)).

#### Who's it for? Anyone looking for a different night (or day) out.            
We don't want to put you off by talking labels — yes there'll be theatre, live art, dance — the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening — there'll be something you might want to take a chance on.                 
         
#### What our audiences have said about the work  
>• *Astonishing. Like nothing else. Transformative, immersive, moving.*<br>• *Brave, dark, humerous, intimate, intense.*<br>• *Heartwarming, funny + engaging.*<br>• *Strangely mesmeric. A unique experience.*<br>• *Very enjoyable — felt accessible and thus enjoyable to all.*<br>• *You programme wonderful, daring performances that I have never been disappointed by.*          
         
#### Who is Word of Warning?         
My name's Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called [hÅb](/hab), which was greenroom's partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events — like [Emergency](http://emergencymcr.org) (Manchester's free marathon of live work, now in its nineteenth year) and [Hazard](http://hazardmcr.org) (biennial random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).
         
I've been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I've been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape, and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon *Hallelujah chorus*! On the less eccentric side, over the years hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young NW artists to help them create new pieces of theatre + dance.           
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at <mailto:info@habmcr.org>             
         
I'm joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom's long time programme co-ordinator, the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events; we’re grateful for the support of Catherine (Cat) Shaw, and our occasional band of hÅbettes.           
        
#### What our audiences have said about us           
>• *Always special, bringing the unexpected and intriguing, thank you.*<br>• *Bringing some of the most interesting performance work in the world to our city.*<br>• *Fabulous for seeing things different from the mainstream machine.*<br>• *Great organisation — a reason to move to Manchester.*<br>• *I don't know what I would do with my spare time without you.*<br>• *Refreshing company that brings diverse shows to our door steps.*<br>• *WoW are great, supporting emerging work and bringing it to new audiences.*
