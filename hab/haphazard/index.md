**Haphazard** is our occasional foray into 'all ages' live art, with intriguing images and offbeat oddities dotted in and around the historic <a href="http://www.z-arts.org" target="_blank">Z-arts</a> building in Manchester's Hulme. Playful, quirky, engaging and sometimes plain daft: this is a free day out for kids and their adults, adults and *their* adults — in short, anyone looking for a different day out!

hÅb | Word of Warning and Z-arts are getting together again for the 5th Haphazard, taking place on **Sat 27 Apr 2019** in Manchester.        
There will be a call for proposals in the New Year, but we know ‘all ages’ can be a challenge - so we wanted to give you a heads-up and some thinking time!          

This is not live art for children but live art for all ages - and we mean from tot to timeworn, 8 months to 80 years - so work should have appeal for adults and children alike (even if the kids need to explain it to the adults!).        

To date, Haphazard has seen ping pong balls and squeaky toys; human dogs, cats, giant rats and the Gendersaurus Rex; hula-hooping and human quoits; a giant periscope, a golden toilet and a tiny bee-shaped world… to get a feel for it have a look at [2017](/galleries/2017-haphazard)/[2016](/galleries/2016-haphazard)/[2015](/galleries/2015-haphazard)/[2013](/galleries/2013-haphazard)'s image galleries and to get an idea of what's gone before see [2017](/archive/2017-haphazard)/[2016](/archive/2016-haphazard)/[2015](/archive/2015-haphazard)/[2013](/archive/2013-spring/haphazard)'s archives.     

From experience, what works best are big surreal images, interesting repetitive movement and nothing too text heavy. We have access to a variety of spaces: a café, an atrium, some small spaces, some stairwells and a big black box. Durational, intervention, and ‘come and go’ work seems to work the best - we’re not really looking for sit-down theatre shows.
