#### About         
In [2013](/archive/2013-domestic)/[15](/archive/2015-domestic)/[17](/archive/2017-autumnwinter/pritchard) we presented Domestic works in tower blocks in transition — little did we know then, that in 2020 our homes would become our only stages and only auditoria…        
        
And so we began a series of ["Domestic at homes"](/archive/2020-domestic), with artists trying out new works about what was on their minds — using whatever resources they had to hand.       
        
Join us on 13 January for our fourth set of "artists at home" — selected from our <a href="http://domesticmcr.posthaven.com" target="_blank">rolling open call for proposals</a>. Real lives, real stories, real homes.         
         
#### Programme         
Avital Raz · *A Woman's Voice Is Her Nakedness*<br>&nbsp;'A Woman's Voice is her Nakedness', some Rabbi said in the 10th century — and that caused millions of women to shut up. Avital explores the effect of male teachings about women on women, and endeavours through distortion to find a woman's voice.        
        
Loïs Soleil · *In between the lines you are a poem*<br>&nbsp;NEEDS COPY. This piece creates a reflection on language and how we can play with it as a medium (above the initial thing we're trying to say).<br>&nbsp;An interactive self portrait ("different selves" within different days and moods); a love poem recited in a robotic way (love and technology/feelings online).<br>&nbsp;Loïs is interested in how technology impacts the way we interact with each other, with our bodies and ourselves?        
        
Lydia Cottrell · *DOOMSDAY BOOKS*<br>&nbsp;Our future hangs in the balance sheets, it's accrual world and we can depreciate it together. Standing at the ledger the earth, let's get fiscal as we liquidate our assets. Account me out and calc-u-later.<br>&nbsp;A performance that accounts for the end of the world, based on the Rapture Index and Religious Eschatology.        
        
Miray Sidhom · *THE BREAD WE BREAK*<br>&nbsp;NEEDS COPY.<br>&nbsp;Development commissioned/supported by Contact?        
        
Mitzee (DEAD PIG) · *Dragging up (working title)*<br>&nbsp;A comment on Transformation, posing questions around beauty and how as human beings we are all able to have unlimited rebirths.<br>&nbsp;Witness live, for the first time, the transformation of a Male to Mitzee… getting ready for a performance that is never going to happen.        
        
Voidance Company · *Underneath the frying pan…*
<br>&nbsp;Slowly but surely a rage has built inside her like the worm in Irvine Welsh's *Filth*. Surrounded by lethal kitchen utensils, and simmering with rage, a solo dancer explores the hostility of the familiar amongst the detritus of domesticity.<br>&nbsp;A dance video solo accompanied by pots & pans, drawers & cupboards, and a cast of cutlery that seeks to answer the question 'why did the rage get to you?'
