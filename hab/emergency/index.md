**Emergency**, our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance, is celebrating its fifteenth birthday…!  
To get a feel for it see 2013's [programme](/archive/2013-emergency) + [image gallery](/galleries/2013-emergency).

Somewhat of an institution in these parts, **Emergency** is our annual platform for live art and contemporary performance featuring up to 40 short pieces of work in a single day, across a number of Manchester venues.        
       
         
**Emergency is:**    
>a free, public micro-festival + open submission platform;   
>an opportunity for artists to meet, show and peer-review work;      
>a selection event for a number of small [Works Ahead](/hab/worksahead) commissions to be developed + supported by hÅb.
