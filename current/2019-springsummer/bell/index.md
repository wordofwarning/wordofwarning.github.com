#### More         
What happens when opposing fronts sweep across the shifting landscape of the gendered body? Can we intervene in newly forming identities, or must we surrender to their unpredictability?         
        
Amy Bell dances and talks her way through this witty and dream-like solo performance, riding the blustery winds of aspiration and becoming, all the while hoping her umbrella doesn't get turned inside out.        
         
Immersed in a live digital soundscape by composer Jamie McCarthy, with dramaturgy + animation from visual artist Hetain Patel, Amy tackles the all too human longings and frustrations of transformation, trying to read the forecast, and wondering how we will know when we've arrived.        
         
#### Who is she?        
A Brighton-based dance artist whose work embraces performing, making, writing, teaching, and curation, Amy Bell's recent works use the interplay and slippage between words and body to interrogate processes of change in felt gender and sexual identities.            
       
Amy's performance work has included theatrical, installation, and site-sensitive works for Tino Sehgal, Hussein Chalayan & Damien Jalet, Alessandro Sciarroni, Lea Anderson, Charlotte Spencer, Chiara Frigo, Marco D’Agostin, and Maresa von Stockert’s Tilted Productions, amongst others. Chiara Frigo created her tap dance solo *West End* for Amy in 2015, and she currently tours with Alessandro Sciarroni. Previously, together with Valentina Golfieri, she made a series of darkly absurd short duets, and has also created collaborations with live artist Lucy Hutson, and *Cotton Panic* with actress Jane Horrocks.           
          
Amy curated *Splayed*: a festival of disruptive femininities at The Place in June 2018, and *Bend It* in 2016+17: a queer performance night at Yorkshire Dance; she also led *Next Choreography*: a course for young makers at Siobhan Davies Dance 2016-2018. She teaches and lectures widely, facilitating choreographic workshops, discussions, and technical training for dancers and non-dancers across the world. Amy read English at Cambridge University, trained at London Contemporary Dance School, and is currently Artist Development Manager at The Place.

As this is a Pay What You Decide event, we know some people who book tickets won't turn up on the night so we send out more tickets than there are places. We do our best to get the numbers right but we advise you arrive early to ensure you get a seat! We don't often have to disappoint people but if we can't fit you in we will try to offer you tickets to another show in The Lowry that night.
