After performing as a professional wrestler for 22 years across Europe, he transitioned into live art, discovering it could lend an authenticity to his work which couldn’t be displayed in the theatricality of wrestling.

**6-10pm | Tink Flaherty | *Sit With Me***           
A participatory performance in which the audience are invited to sit with the artist for as little or as long as they want.<br>Sitting side by side with another person is the foundation of this work, which is driven by the artist’s own experience as a neuro-divergent person + the challenges they face connecting ‘appropriately’ in a predominantly neuro-typical world.<br>This intimate performance is offering people a place to sit on a first level + secondly the opportunity to think about how + why we connect with each other.<br>**Tink Flaherty** is a working-class theatre practitioner; a queer gender rebel; a loving parent living with a disability.

**6.30-9.30pm | Martin Hamblen | *The Caller***         
Calling out the names of living artists is an attempt to give each name equanimity. Drawn from a hat, each artist will inspire a micromental performance. 180 names, 1 per minute.<br>*The Caller* (2020) represents a turn away from **Martin Hamblen**’s modus operandi of performing phrases. At NIAMOS he has taken inspiration from Paul McCarthy’s *The Painter* (1995).

**6.30-7pm + 8-8.30pm + 9-9.30pm | Bethany Mountain | *15.8% Tired***         
When asked ‘how are you?’ 15.8% of people replied ‘tired’. The word tired is used to say that someone is not okay but doesn't want to talk about it.

**7-8pm | Kris Canavan | *All Roads Lead To Shit***         
When those who hold the balance of power refuse to show remorse for the hate-filled words they spew + cannot be held accountable for their actions, then all roads truly do lead to shit.<br>Since 2001 **Kris Canavan** has used their body as a site to be manipulated, contorted, sculpted, pierced + mined for the creation of artworks. They see their methods used in the creation of artworks (by utilising their body + its resources) as a political ownership of their body; a rejection of the status quo + subservience that is expected of us by the state — essentially their works can be viewed as gestures of defiance + dissent.<br>(Includes nudity; see content warnings [here](/warnings).)

**8-10pm | Powder Keg | *Line Dancing In Clitheroe***          
In this space, Powder Keg + a group of performers reflect on how learning a dance routine shaped our lives, + what it meant for you as a generation, as a gender, how it informed who your friends were. Why did you want to be the centre of attention at a disco, hyped up on panda pops? *Reach For The Stars* or *The Macarena*? What was your song? Would the DJ let you have it? Is it Steps’ routine or did you make it up? Or did you just slide around the room on your knees instead? This is part-dance, part-theatre, part-reflection. Come have a boogie.<br>**Powder Keg** explore contemporary politics with a gut-punch response. They make theatre to provoke anger + empathy. Care is a central part of their practice both inside + outside the rehearsal room, + they are constantly exploring + evaluating their social responsibility as artists.<br>(See content warnings [here](/warnings).)
