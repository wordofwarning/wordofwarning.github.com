#### More      
Each audience member is blindfolded. They are then individually hugged by a singer. Unable to visually gauge their surroundings, participants experience the performance through sound, breath and vibrations of the body as the choir of voices deliver the song. Playing with sense and perspective, *HUG* is a unique examination of the human voice's power.            
        
*'I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'*<br>Walt Whitman – *Song of Myself*        
         
#### Who is she?     
Bristol-based, Verity Stenden trained in music at Dartington College of Arts; her work as a composer, musical director and performer explores the human voice and how it can be celebrated and transformed through live performance.            
         
In addition to her solo work and running her choir (Utterance) she regularly collaborates with a range of artists and companies across the UK, also as an outside eye + ear, vocal coach, facilitator and lecturer. Her current composition projects include *Medusa* (Bristol Old Vic) + *The Light Princess* (Tobacco Factory Theatres), and she has been nominated for an Off West End Award, The Arches Brick Award and a Total Theatre Award.           
        
#### What people have said about *HUG*        
>★★★★★ *To feel somebody’s 'horax vibrate as they tackle an elaborate countermelody feels like the most immediate, visceral experience of music as human expression possible… like an antenna to heaven.*<br><a href="http://URL" target="_blank">TimeOut</a>        
>★★★★ *Song erupts around you… it’s'startling, moving and genuinely immersive.*<br><a href="http://URL" target="_blank">???Lyn Gardner, The Guardian</a>        
>*SOUND ROSE AND FELL IN WAVES UNTIL IT FELT AS IF I WAS DRENCHED IN MUSIC THAT HAD SEEPED ITS WAY INTO EVERY ORGAN IN MY BODY, AND MAYBE EVEN FOUND MY SOUL*<br>Lyn Gardner, Guardian        
>★★★★ *THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN JUST SENSATION. HUG IS ALSO A STRANGELY CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE, UNEQUIVOCALLY ILLUSTRATING THE POWER THAT MUSIC HOLDS TO MOVE US…*<br><a href="http://URL" target="_blank">Exeunt</a>
