#### Access Information        
Age advisory: ***??***+ (parental/guardian discretion). With no interval, this is a durational performance installation, with audience members free to come and go as they please; to have an intense 1-2-1 chorus of *Over the Rainbow* sung (very directly) to you by FK: you will need to queue in person on the evening to take a (free) numbered ticket. The show contains small moments of strobe and noise music; it's not quiet, but it is loving — earplugs are available on request. For specific age and access information please email <mailto:info@habarts.org> or call 0161 232 6086.      
         
#### More      
With live accompaniment from Glasgow-based noise band Okishima Island Tourist Association, FK Alexander sings along to the recording of the last time Judy Garland ever sang *Over the Rainbow*, four months before her death.        
        
Stand hand-in-hand with FK, and witness others do the same in this intimate interactive live experience of undivided attention and love.

#### Who is she?     
FK Alexander's practice centres on aggressive healing, radical wellness, public vulnerability, noise music, 12 step recovery… She believes personal transformation is real, deep change is possible, and that we are trying to recover from something/one.

Making work by herself and with others for no-one in particular, she strongly welcomes everyone — whether that work be live art or to go on a stage, the street, on headphones, in front of a camera, on a wall, or on a page.
