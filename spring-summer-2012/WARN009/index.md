####In Brief
Three artists, three performances, three takes on singledom and the onset of the thirties. An emerging programme full of surprises and an insight into performance that defies definition.

####More
October 2011 saw an extraordinary coming together of over 30 artists in a day-long "maze of performance": [emergency accommodation](http://emergencymcr.org/).  Two whole buildings resonated with small exchanges, moving installations and intriguing conversations, punctuated by naked encounters and full-blown performances. Recapturing that spirit of adventure, **Works Ahead** invites a group of the most intriguing emergency accommodation artists to develop and present their work in a takeover of Contact Space 1.
