Welcome to Word of Warning's Autumn/Winter 2012 collection... the season where we rock... or at least we try to...     

Loud music, thrashing performers, tales of living fast and dying young.  Smoke, flashing lights and even white powder!     

We return to an old haunt - in its new guise as a gig venue - and move forward with our thirteenth Emergency in three new venues.  All that and Friday nights at Z-arts too.
