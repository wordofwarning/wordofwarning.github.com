####Who Are They?
Since moving to Chicago in 2004, Brian has worked with, and for, Steppenwolf Theatre Company, The Goodman Theatre and Next Theatre.  His directing credits include *The Gunslinger (and a baby)* at Breadline Theatre and *Night-Cher at 20,000 Feet* for Hell in a Handbag Productions.  In Ann Arbor, he was the co-creator and co-director *After A Fashion* with performance artist Holly Hughes, which was later remounted at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Brian was the recipient of the 2004 Hopwood Drama Award and a 2006 and 2007 CAAP Grant from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs.   His second solo performance, *Other Funny Stories About Cancer*, premiered was a Critic's Choice in the Chicago Reader, who called the play *"raw and ambitious"*. Brian Lobel was listed as one of Chicago's *30 Under 30* by the Windy City Times, in 2007, before moving to London. He was a 2008 recipient of a Wellcome Arts Award for a new project, *Fun With Cancer Patients*

####What People Have Said About Them
*"Critic's Pick: it is really terrific..."* - Chicago Public Radio     
*"a harrowing story about America's health system, told with humor and pungency"*-Windy City Times    
*"a tour de force!"* -Hopwood Award Committee    
*"He's brave, honest, and above all, willing to laugh at the absurdities and atrocities of cancer."* -Wayne State Medical Student blogger, Kat Burgatt,    

####More
Far from the world of yellow bracelets and pink ribbons, *Ball* is the story of a young man and his quirky and unique struggle against cancer and, more importantly, the Lance Armstrong-dominated cancer narrative. This is not your mother's illness drama - *Ball* sees all of the disgusting parts of cancer not as things which should be changed into things beautiful or inspirational. Instead, the sperm bank, the catheters, and the hair loss take center stage in all their glory, in a manner which is irreverent, honest, and, ultimately, healing. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to perform a self-exam. Directed by Margot Bordelon.

 Although Brian officially retired *Ball* in 2007, and moved to London it sneaks back into his life and into the world... In 2008, *Ball* was performed for Performing Medicine at Royal London Hospital and at Barts and The London. In 2009, *Ball* was performed at University of Southampton. *Ball* was published in Text and Performance Quarterly in 2008, and is available for purchase on DVD. Brian also offers in-home performances of *Ball*, which is a very fun and original gift.
