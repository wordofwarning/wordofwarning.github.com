[Spring 2013](/archive/2013-spring/index.html) is done and dusted with seven shows at Contact, Kraak, The Lowry & Z-arts, with ten more shows in a manic day of all ages live art filling Z-arts.

And so to the second half of our bumper season that, despite the best the weather can throw at us, we are choosing to call Spring/Summer 2013!    

April into May sees almost 50 shows — including the return of **'Poolside Emergency** + **Turn**; a double bill featuring *The Mighty Boosh*'s **Stuart Silver** and a micro-commission by Manchester's own **Tam Hinton**; and seven new pieces forming **Works Ahead** at Contact.        
        
May into June continues with **imitating the dog**; a commissioned preview of **Michael Pinchbeck's *The Middle*** in a double bill with **Sheila Ghelani**; **Andy Field** (of Forest Fringe)'s three part ***Zilla!***; rounded off with Fringe First-winning **Jenna Watt**.    
 
####What is Word of Warning and where did it come from?
Simply put, Word of Warning is a one-stop shop for the bonkers, the beautiful and the bizarre of live performance: an attempt to keep alive the best of the 25 year greenroom legacy and to introduce new people to the possibilities of seeing live work in Manchester.

We take live work very seriously – but we don't take ourselves seriously at all. In 2012, alongside funny, thought-provoking, beautiful work by the likes of Third Angel, Ellie Harrison, GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN, Levantes Dance Theatre, Action Hero, Richard DeDomenici, Made In China and many more, we served the audience gin and satsuma jello shots, played bingo, apple-bobbing, drenched them in confetti and reinvented St Andrews Day with snowballs and whisky macs.

####Who’s it for?
**Anyone looking for a different night out**.    

We don’t want to put you off by talking labels – yes there’ll be theatre, live art, dance – but the aim is to be anything but elitist or po-faced. So if you like comedy, music, gaming or just a friendly, stimulating evening – there’ll be something you might want to take a chance on.

####Who is Word of Warning?
My name’s Tamsin Drury and I run an organisation called [hÅb](/hab/index.html), which was greenroom’s partner for over a decade. You might not know hÅb but you might know some of our events – like **Emergency** (Manchester’s free marathon of live work with 40 shows in 3 venues) and **Hazard** (random sprees of eccentricity in Manchester's City Centre).

I’ve been around a while, a really long while… and in that time, I’ve been responsible for making the Arndale Tower flash, wrapping Cathedral Gardens in 7km of hazard tape and encouraging a mass audience conga and a glitter-cannon Hallelujah chorus!    

On the less eccentric side over the years, hÅb has also worked with literally hundreds of young north west artists to help them create new pieces of theatre and dance.
          
Please send programming enquiries to me at info@habarts.org             

I’m joined in this lunacy by John Franklin, greenroom’s long time programme coordinator. Often spotted in a hat or proffering a variety of bizarre refreshments, John is the friendly face greeting you and eliciting your feedback at many of our events.
