**Frances-Kay | Scaffold**    
Previously seen at this year's ['Poolside Emergency](/archive/2013-poolside/durationala) Frances-Kay's first installation, *Scaffold*, is inspired by her interest the impact of duration on the body and mind. It embodies her explorations of the body,
mind, and interests in religion and feminism; it represents her excitement of performing on high structures and the slight possibility of danger.    

Once again, a big thank you to CH + LJ, and this time FC + DW too.

**Will Dickie | Long Distance Relationship**    
A one-to-one performance in a public space. A meditative exploration
of togetherness and separation. An appreciation of the other as a
figure in dialogue with the background that surrounds it.    
*Take a cassette, stand on this spot, look out at the landscape, and wait.*    
Will Dickie is a performance-maker based in the suburbs of London
whose practice is supported by a long-term commitment to training and
self development, which includes Martial Arts, Butoh Dance and the
Suzuki Actor Training Method. As a performer his work spans theatre,
dance, and interdisciplinary collaboration, including extensive work
with Tadashi Endo, Diego Ferrari, Jo Shapland and Zecora Ura.    

He made his first solo performance work, *Memories of Suburbia*, in
2012 with an awarded bursary from Chisenhale Dance Space. He is now
artist in residence at Battersea Arts Centre where he is developing
his second solo, *Man in Helmet in the Landscape*. Both pieces are
inspired by interviewing those close to him and dancing alone in
public space.

**Zimmermann/Singh | Melancholy Machines**    
A live improvised dialogue between electronic sound and voice and the
projected image; an artistic collaboration between Jason Singh and
Maike Zimmermann.    

Based on a loose principal narrative, *Melancholy Machines* develops a
non-linear form from the live and improvised interaction between the
Sound Artist (Jason Singh) and the Filmmaker/Visual Artist (Maike
Zimmermann). The combination of sonic textures and poetic imagery
unfolds new arrangements, suggesting references to mythologies, social
norms, gender roles, the (post-)digital age and the complex
relationship between gender, self and power.    

At Emergency, *Melancholy Machines* is presented as a 3-channel video
installation; this unique approach is the result of the hybrid
character of the project's concept i.e. the inherent (non-linear)
narrativity residing in the material.    
 
Jason Singh is a Beatboxer, Vocal Sculptor and Sound Artist whose work
is rooted in inspiring people to engage in exciting creative
experiences through the breath, technology, performance and
participation. Using his breath, voice and a range of samplers and
loop pedals, he can vocally recreate sound and music compositions
mimicking a wide range of instruments, genres, atmospheres, wildlife,
and abstract experimental sonic textures. Jason composes music for
film, theatre, dance and facilitates sound and music workshops to
young people and adults. These include Beatboxing, Sound Design and
Music Production. He is an Associate Lecturer at the Manchester
Metropolitan University and has also recently completed a six-month
sound art residency at the V&A Museum.    

Maike Zimmermann's work is image-based (photo, video, 16mm, super8) —
creating experimental films and video, photographic or site-specific
installations. Amongst others she has also made sound recordings for
experimental radio shows. Her work has been shown internationally
including exhibitions in Barcelona, Berlin, London, San Francisco, St
Petersburg and Stockholm. She has been contributing images and videos
to publications and channels such as Creative Review, The
Guardian/Observer, Vogue online, DAZEDdigital, frieze magazine,
Islamic Art Magazine, BBC, ITV, ARTE (Tracks) and many more. In
2011/2012 she was artist in residence at no.w.here, an artist film
space in London, and has been employed at the V&A as a video content
producer, video editor and photographer. In January 2013 she began a
three-month residency program at Harvestworks (New Media Arts Centre)
in New York.

**Chloë Smith | I’ve been dreaming of this since I was a boy**   
*You cannot evict an idea. Such is the message of defiance from Occupy. But it is not entirely true. For the whole point of Occupy is that it's not just an idea bouncing around the internet. Occupy is stubbornly about the physical reality of space.* — Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral     

Recently graduated from Dartington College of Arts / Falmouth University, Chloë Smith is an artist interested in making work that is honest, intimate and socially relevant. Her recent projects have included a month-long residency in South London looking at home, and a site-specific work in a derelict house.
