If you like what we do, you can support us in a number of ways:    
**by [signing-up for the mailer](http://wordofwarning.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0d0b9e09079cc9204f77cb396&id=d72a36f1c2)**    
or    
**by coming along to shows**  
or    
**by [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E)**   
   
All donations, no matter how small, are very welcome.  So if you've a lonely fiver going begging, then why not give it a good home? We will put it to very good use - supporting artists and interesting nights out in Manchester.   

We're sure we don't need to preach about straitened times and the onus on the arts to prove its worth and to attract private giving.  However, [with 70% of all philanthropy going to London organisations](http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/121126-Peter-Philips-philanthropy-in-the-regions.pdf), and without a building to focus attention, a small peripatetic organisation like us needs all its supporters' help.    
   
So to help us demonstrate we're 'doing our bit' click [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LC9G9CWHVDQ8E) or drop a couple of coins in a collecting tin at one of our free events.     

**We'll send web donors an exclusive personalised laminate to say thanks!**
